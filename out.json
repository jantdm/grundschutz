[{"heading": "# T 0.1 Fire", "description": "Fire can cause severe damage to people, buildings and their facilities. In addition to damage resulting directly from fire, consequential damages can be identified, which can assume catastrophic proportions in their damage effect especially for Information Technology. Damage resulting from fire-fighting water, for instance, does not occur only at the location of the fire. It can arise also in lower lying areas of the building. During incineration of PVC, chlorine gases are produced, which form hydrochloric acid when combined with moisture in the air and water for fire-fighting. When hydrochloric acid vapour is disseminated via the air-conditioning system, damage can thus be incurred to sensitive electronic devices, located in a very remote part of the building from the scene of the fire. However, \"ordinary\" fire smoke can also have a damaging impact on IT-equipment in this way.\nNot only negligent handling of fire (e.g. unattended open flames, welding and soldering works), but also improper use of electrical appliances (e.g. unattended coffee machine, overloading of multi-socket adapters) can result in an outbreak of fire. Technical defects of electrical equipment can lead to a fire as well.\nThe propagation of fire can be promoted by:\n* keeping fire-proof doors open using wedges,\n* inappropriate storage of combustible materials (e.g. waste paper),\n* failure to follow relevant fire protection standards and instructions,\n* lack of fire detection and alarm systems (e.g. smoke detectors),\n* missing or unprepared hand-held or automatic fire extinguishers (gas extinguishing systems),\n* inadequate fire prevention facilities (e.g. lack of fire insulation in cable routes or use of unsuitable insulating materials for thermal and acoustic insulation).\n", "examples": "* At the beginning of the 90s a mainframe computer centre in the Frankfurt area suffered catastrophic fire damage leading to a complete failure.\n* It often happens that small electrical appliances, such as coffee machines or table lamps, are improperly installed and therefore cause fires.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.2 Unfavourable Climatic Conditions", "description": "Unfavourable climatic conditions like heat, frost or high humidity can lead to a wide variety of damage, like malfunctions in technical components or damage of storage media. Frequent fluctuations of climatic conditions amplify these effects. Unfavourable climatic conditions can also lead to a situation where people are no longer capable of working or where they are injured or killed.\nEvery human being and every technical appliance has a temperature range, within which normal operation or proper functioning is guaranteed. Whenever the ambient temperature exceeds the lower or the upper limit of this range, it may cause absences from work (stoppages), operational disruptions or device failures.\nFor example, electrical energy is converted into heat in a server room owing to the devices inside and thus heating the room up. In cases of insufficient ventilation, the permissible operating temperature of the devices inside can be exceeded. Under solar exposure, the temperature in the room can reach 50 degrees Celsius.\nFor the purpose of ventilation, windows in server rooms are frequently opened without permission. In seasonal transition periods with major temperature fluctuations (spring, autumn), this can result in exceeding the permissible air humidity due to severe cooling.\nWhen storing digital long-term storage media, excessive fluctuations of temperature or a too high humidity level can lead to data errors or a reduced data retention period. Some manufacturers state that the optimum storage conditions for long-term storage media are temperatures ranging from 20 to 22\u00b0C and an air humidity of 40%. Also, analogue media like paper or microfilms require certain storage conditions. If, for instance, paper is stored in too humid a place, it can get mouldy or disintegrate.\n", "examples": "* In cases of high summer temperatures and inadequate cooling of IT equipment, temperature-dependent failures can occur.\n* Too much dust in IT systems can lead to a build-up of heat.\n* Too high temperatures can cause demagnetisation of magnetic data storage media.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.3 Water", "description": "Water can affect the integrity and availability of information stored on analogue and digital data storage media. Also information in the RAM of IT systems is at risk. An uncontrolled admission of water into a building or into rooms can, for instance, result from:\n* disruptions in the water supply or sewage disposal,\n* defective heating system,\n* defective air-conditioning systems with a water supply,\n* defective sprinkler systems,\n* water used during a fire-fighting operation and * water sabotage e.g. performed by opening taps and blocking drains.\nRegardless of how water enters into the building or into rooms, it entails the risk that supply facilities or IT components will be damaged and taken out of operation (a short circuit, mechanical damage, rust, etc.). Especially if central supply facilities of the building (main power distributor, telephone, and data) are housed in basement rooms without automatic drainage, The ingress of water can cause extremely high losses.\nIn addition, problems resulting from frost can arise. For example in frost-endangered areas, pipes can start to leak if water stands still inside them, accompanied by persistent frost. Even existing thermal insulation will also be overcome by frost in time.\n", "examples": "* In a server room, there was a water pipe running beneath the ceiling which was covered with plasterboard panels. When a coupling in the water pipe started to leak, this was not recognised in time. At first the leaking water collected in the deepest point of the cladding, before it flowed out and caused a short circuit in the power distributor attached underneath. As a consequence until it was finally repaired, both water and power supplies of the corresponding part of the building had to be switched off completely.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.4 Pollution, Dust, Corrosion", "description": "Besides electronics, many IT devices contain mechanical components, such as hard drives and removable disks, DVD drives, printers, scanners etc. and coolers for CPUs and power supply units also. With increasing quality and speed requirements, these devices must function more and more precisely. Even small amounts of pollution can lead to disruption of a device. Dust and pollution in significant amounts can for example be generated by the following activities:\n* repairs on walls, raised floors (double floors) or other building parts,\n* hardware upgrades or similar work * packaging (e.g. Styrofoam particles)\nExisting safety circuits in the equipment usually ensure a timely switching off of the device. This restricts the direct damage to the affected device, keeps the repair costs low and the downtimes short, but the affected device remains unavailable during down-time.\nIn addition, equipment and infrastructure can be damaged by corrosion. This can have a negative impact not only on IT but even on the safety of buildings.\nCorrosion can also indirectly lead to further risks. For example, when water flows out of corroded water pipes (see T 0.3 Water).\nAltogether, pollution, dust or corrosion can therefore lead to failure of or damage to IT components and supply facilities. As a consequence, proper information processing can be impaired.\n", "examples": "* After installation of a server in a media room, together with a photocopier and a fax machine, errors within the CPU cooler and the power supply fan occurred successively due to the high dust level in the room. The breakdown of the CPU cooler led to sporadic server crashes. The breakdown of the power supply fan finally led to an overheating of the power supply unit resulting in a short circuit, which eventually entailed a total failure of the server.\n* To hang up a blackboard in an office, holes were drilled into the wall by the site technical service. During this, the office employee had left his office for a short time. After he returned to his workplace he noticed that his PC no longer functioned. The reason for this was the ingress of dust from drilling into the PC power supply unit through the ventilation slits.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.5 Natural Disasters", "description": "With natural disasters natural changes are meant which have a devastating impact on people and infrastructures. Causes for a natural disaster can be seismic, climatic or volcanic phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, tsunamis, avalanches and volcanic eruptions. Examples of extreme meteorological phenomena are thunderstorms, hurricanes or cyclones. Depending on its location, the institution is exposed to these risks stemming from various types of natural disasters to a greater or lesser degree.\n", "examples": "* In the case of computing centres in flood-endangered areas, there is a particular danger of water entering into the building in an uncontrolled manner (flooding or phreatic rise).\n* The frequency of earthquakes and hence the risk accompanying them depends strongly on the geographical location.\n* Extremely high solar activity has in the past repeatedly led to impairments of telecommunications infrastructures and the energy supply.\nIndependent of the type of natural disaster, even in areas not directly affected by it, the danger exists that supply facilities, communication links or IT components will be damaged or put out of operation. In particular, the failure of the central supply facilities of the building (main power distributor, telephone, data) can cause very high losses. Access to the infrastructure by the maintenance and service staff can be impeded due to extensive restricted areas.\n## Examples:\n* Many commercial enterprises, also large companies, do not take the threat of floods into account adequately. There is a company which has been \"surprised\" by flood damage in their computing centre several times already. The computing centre literally swam away after flood damage for the second time within 14 months. The loss incurred amounted to several hundred thousand Euros and this has not been covered by insurance.\n* An IT system has been installed at a site with a geographic location well-known for a volcanic activity (intermittent phenomenon, where volcanic emission phases alternate with somewhat long resting phases).\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.6 Environmental Disasters", "description": "A public body or a company can suffer damage when a serious accident happens in its environment, for instance, a fire, an explosion, a release of poisonous substances or a dangerous radiation leak. Therefore, the danger is not only due to the event itself but often to activities resulting there from, for example access restrictions and rescue measures.\nThe property of an institution can be exposed to a variety of threats originating from the environment, among other things from traffic (streets, rail, air, and water), neighbouring companies or residential areas.\nEven preventative or rescue measures can affect the property directly. Such measures can also lead to a situation where employees cannot reach their workplace or staff must be evacuated. However, the complexity of site technical service and IT infrastructure can also give rise to indirect problems.\n", "examples": "* Due to a fire outbreak in a chemical plant in the immediate proximity of a computing centre (approx. 1000 m as the crow flies), a large cloud of smoke arose. The computing centre had an air conditioning and ventilation system which did not have any external air monitoring. Thanks only to the attention of an employee (the accident happened during working hours) who observed the emergence and spreading of the cloud, the external air supply could be manually switched off.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.7 Major Events in the Environment", "description": "Major events of every kind can impede the proper operation of a public body or a company. They include amongst other things street festivals, concerts, sporting events, industrial action or demonstrations. Riots in connection with such events can have additional consequences, like intimidation of employees up to the use of force against the staff or the building.\n", "examples": "* During the hot summer months, a demonstration took place nearby a computing centre. The situation escalated resulting in violence. In a side street, a window of the computing centre area was still opened, through which a demonstrator gained access and used the opportunity to steal hardware with important data stored on it.\n* During the construction of a big funfair, electric cables were cut by mistake. This led to a failure in a computing centre connected through it. This failure however, could be backed-up by the emergency power supply.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.8 Failure or Disruption of the Power Supply", "description": "In spite of high security of supply in the electricity sector, interruptions to the power supply on behalf of the distribution network operators or energy supply companies continue to occur. The majority of these disruptions are so short, with times of less than one second, that a human does not notice them. But interruptions of more than even 10 ms are capable of disrupting IT operation. However, besides disruptions in the supply networks, also shut-downs caused by unheralded works or cable damage due to civil engineering work, can lead to power failures.\nIt is not only those obvious, direct consumers of power (PC, lighting etc.) which are dependent on the power supply. Many infrastructure facilities depend on electric power today, e.g. lifts, air-conditioning devices, alarm systems, security gates, automatic door locking and sprinkler systems. Even the water supply in skyscrapers is power-dependent because of pumps in the upper floors required for producing pressure. Prolonged power outages resulting in failure of the infrastructure facilities can lead to a situation where no activity can be undertaken on these premises any more.\nBesides failures, other disruptions of the power supply can impair the operation also. Voltage spikes can, for example, lead to malfunctions or even damage of the electrical equipment.\nIn addition it has to be taken into account that sometimes failures or disruptions of the power supply in the neighbourhood can affect one's own business processes, if access routes are blocked for instance.\n", "examples": "* Due to an error in the uninterrupted power supply unit of a computing centre, the unit was unable to return to normal operation after a short power failure. After discharging of its batteries (which took about 40 minutes) all computers in the respective server hall failed.\n* At the beginning of 2001 in California there was a power supply crisis for more than 40 days. The power supply situation there was so tense that the Californian Independent System Operator ordered rotating power cuts. Not only households but also the high-tech industry was affected by these power cuts which lasted up to 90 minutes. Since during the power failure alarm systems and surveillance cameras were also turned off, the energy suppliers kept their shut-down schedule secret.\n* In November 2005 many communities in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia remained without a power supply for days after intense snowfall, because many pylons were knocked over by the load of snow and ice. The recovery of the power supply took several days.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.9 Failure or Disruption of Communication Networks", "description": "Many business processes nowadays require at the very least intact communication connections, be it telephone, fax, email or other services using local or wide area networks. If one or more of these communication connections are not available over a longer period of time, the result can, for example, be that:\n* Business processes cannot be continued any longer because the required information cannot be retrieved,\n* Customers cannot contact the institution for inquiries any more,\n* Orders cannot be commissioned or completed.\nIf time-critical applications are run on IT systems which are connected via wide area networks, the possible losses and consequential damages due to a network failure are correspondingly high if no alternatives (e.g. connection to another communications network) are available.\nSimilar problems can arise if the required communications networks are disturbed even though they have not completely failed. Communication links can show increased error rates or other quality shortcomings for example. Wrong configuration parameters also can lead to impairments.\n", "examples": "* For many institutions the Internet has become an indispensable communication medium today, for the retrieval of important information, for representation purposes and for communication with customers and partners, amongst other things. Companies specialising in Internet-based services are of course eminently dependent on an operating Internet connection in particular.\n* Benefiting from convergence of networks, voice and data services are frequently transmitted over the same technical components (e.g. VoIP). This however, increases the danger that at a disruption in communication technology leads to a failure of both voice and data services.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.10 Failure or Disruption of Mains Supply", "description": "In a building there are a variety of networks used for basic supply and disposal services and, as such, form a basis for all of an institution's business processes, including IT. Examples of such supply networks are:\n* power,\n* telephone,\n* cooling,\n* heating or ventilation,\n* water and sewage,\n* supply of fire fighting water,\n* gas,\n* alarm and control systems (e.g. for burglary, fire, housekeeping control engineering) and * intercoms.\nA failure or disruption of a supply network can lead to a situation where, amongst other things, people cannot work in the building any more or IT operation and hence information processing is impaired.\nCertain networks are dependent on each other to varying degrees so that operational disruptions in individual networks can also have an effect on others.\n", "examples": "* A failure of heating or ventilation can have the consequence that all employees must leave the affected buildings. This can, under certain circumstances, result in high losses.\n* The failure of a power supply does not only directly affect IT but also all other networks which are equipped with electrical automatic controls. Even in sewage lines, electrical lifting pumps are used in some circumstances.\n* A failure of the water supply may affect the proper function of air-conditioning systems.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.11 Failure or Disruption of Service Providers", "description": "Hardly any institution today operates without service providers like subcontractors or outsourcing providers. If organisational units are dependent on service providers, their performance can be impaired due to the absence of external services. A partial or complete outage of an outsourcing service provider or a subcontractor can have a considerable effect on operational continuity, particularly in the case of critical business processes. There are different reasons for such outages, for example insolvency, unilateral termination of contract by the service provider or subcontractor, operational problems due to forces of nature or shortfall of personnel for example. Problems can also arise if the services rendered by the service provider do not correspond to the quality requirements of the contractor.\nIn addition, it has to be taken into account that service providers also frequently resort to subcontractors to make their services available to the contractor. Disruptions, quality defects and failures on the part of the subcontractors can thus indirectly lead to impairments in relation to the contractor.\nThe contractor's business processes can also be impaired by failures of the service provider's IT systems or communication connections.\nCeasing to outsource service processes, if it proves necessary, can be considerably complicated, because the outsourced procedures are not adequately documented or because the former service provider does not support this realignment, for instance.\n", "examples": "* A company has installed its servers in a computing centre of an external service provider. After a fire in this computing centre, the finance department of the company was no longer capable of working. It resulted in considerable financial losses for the company.\n* The just-in-time production of a company's products was dependent on the subcontracted supply of material from external service providers. After a provider's lorry failed due to a defect, the delivery of parts urgently required was drastically delayed. This way, a number of customers could not receive their deliveries, timely.\n* A banking institute handled all monetary transports using a cash-in-transit company. The latter company surprisingly declared itself bankrupt. The agreement and route planning with a new valuables carrier took several days. This led to considerable problems and time delays in cash supply to and collections from the affected branches of the bank.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.12 Interfering Radiation", "description": "Today, information technology consists of electronic components to a large extent. Although optical transmission technology is increasingly in use, computers, network coupling elements and storage systems, for example, still generally contain many electronic components. Due to electromagnetic interference having an effect on such components, electronic devices can be impaired in their function or even damaged. As a consequence, disruptions, wrong processing results or communication errors can occur, among other failures.\nWireless communication can also be impaired by interfering radiation. In this case, a sufficiently strong disruption of the used frequency bands is enough in certain circumstances.\nFurthermore, information which is saved on data storage media of certain types can, when under influence of interfering radiation, be deleted or distorted. This refers in particular to magnetically sensitive data storage media (hard disks, magnetic tapes etc.) and semiconductor memory. Damage to such data storage media due to interfering radiation is also possible.\nThere are many different sources of electromagnetic fields or radiation, for example wireless networks (such as WLAN), Bluetooth, GSM, UMTS etc., permanent magnets and cosmic radiation. In addition, every electric device emits electromagnetic waves of varying strength, which can spread amongst others via air and along metallic conductors (e.g. cables, air conditioning ducts, heating pipes etc.).\nIn Germany, regulations in this subject area are stated in the Act for the Electromagnetic\nCompatibility of Resources (EMVG - Gesetz \u00fcber die elektromagnetische Vertr\u00e4glichkeit von\nBetriebsmitteln).\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 0.13 Intercepting Compromising Emissions", "description": "Electrical devices emit electromagnetic waves. In cases of equipment which process information\n(e.g. computers, displays, network coupling elements, printers) this radiation can also carry the information currently being processed with it. Such information-bearing radiation is called expositional or compromising emissions. An attacker, for example in a neighbouring house or in a vehicle parked in the proximity, can try to intercept this radiation and to reconstruct the processed information carried there. The confidentiality of the information is this way called into question. A possible motive for such an attack is industrial espionage.\nThe limiting values in the Act for the Electromagnetic Compatibility of Resources (EMVG) generally do not suffice to prevent interception of the compromising emissions. If this risk cannot be accepted, additional protective measures must therefore be taken.\nCompromising emissions are not restricted to electromagnetic waves. Useful information can sometimes be retrieved from sound waves produced by printers or keyboards, for example.\nIn addition, it has to be taken into account that compromising emissions can be, in some cases, caused or amplified by the external manipulation of devices. If a device is exposed to radiation with electromagnetic waves, it may occur that the reflected waves carry confidential information.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 0.14 Interception of Information / Espionage", "description": "Espionage is defined as attacks aimed at collecting, evaluating and presenting information about companies, people, products or other target objects. The presented information may then be used, for example, to provide certain competitive advantages to another company, blackmail people or build a copy of a product.\nIn addition to a variety of technically complex attacks, there are often also much simpler methods for gaining valuable information, for example by bringing together information from several publicly accessible sources, which looks like harmless information in isolation, but can be compromising in other contexts. Since confidential data is frequently not sufficiently protected, this can often be intercepted using visual, acoustic or electronic ways.\n", "examples": "* Many IT systems are protected against unauthorised access by identification and authentication mechanisms, e.g. in the form of user name and password verification. If the password is transmitted over the wire in an unencrypted form, it is under certain circumstances possible for an attacker to retrieve it.\n* To be able to withdraw money out of an automatic teller machine, the correct PIN for the used electronic cash card or credit card must be entered. Unfortunately, the visual protection available for this equipment is frequently insufficient, so that an attacker can look over the shoulder of a customer entering the pin without much effort. If the attacker steals the card afterwards, he can plunder the account this way. To receive access rights to a PC or to otherwise manipulate it, an attacker can send the user a Trojan Horse which he has enclosed within an email as a supposedly useful programme.\n* In many offices, workplaces are not sufficiently protected in terms of acoustics. As a consequence, colleagues and also visitors could possibly listen to conversations and come to know information which is not meant for them or is even confidential.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.15 Eavesdropping", "description": "Targeted attacks on communication connections, conversations, noise sources of all kinds or IT systems with the objective of collecting information are referred to as eavesdropping. It ranges from unnoticed, surreptitious eavesdropping on a conversation to highly specialised complex attacks in order to intercept signals transmitted over radio or transmission lines, e.g. with the help of antennae or sensors.\nIt is not only because of the low chance of discovery that wiretapping of lines or eavesdropping on wireless connections is a considerable threat for information security. In principle, there are no tap-proof cables. It is only the effort required by the eavesdropper that distinguishes the security of cables. Whether a line is actually wiretapped can only be ascertained through high metrological effort.\nParticularly critical is the unprotected transmission of authentication data in plain-text protocols like HTTP, FTP or telnet, since they can easily be analysed automatically due to the clear structure of the data.\nThe decision to eavesdrop on information somewhere is in principle determined by the question of whether the information is worth the respective technical or financial effort and the risk of being discovered. The answer to this question essentially depends on the individual possibilities and interests of the attacker.\n", "examples": "* In the case of telephone calls, it is not only eavesdropping on conversations that can be of interest to an attacker. The information which is transmitted in signalling can be misused by an attacker as well e.g. due to an incorrect setting in the terminal resulting in the password being transmitted in plain text at the time of login.\n* An attacker can easily eavesdrop on the entire communication if wireless transmission is unprotected or insufficiently protected (e.g. if a WLAN is protected only with WEP).\n* Emails can be read throughout their entire journey through the network if they are not encrypted. Unencrypted emails should therefore not be compared with conventional letters but with postcards.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.16 Theft of Devices, Storage Media and Documents", "description": "The theft of data storage media, IT systems, accessories, software or data, on the one hand results in costs for the replacement and restoring operational status. On the other hand, there are losses due to lack of availability. If confidential information is disclosed due to theft, this can result in further damage. Besides servers and other expensive IT systems, also mobile IT systems, which are unobtrusively and easily transported, are frequently stolen. However, there are also cases in which data storage media like documents or USB-Sticks were purposefully stolen to access confidential information stored there.\n", "examples": "* A notebook computer disappeared from the U.S. Department of State in the spring of 2000. In an official statement, it was not ruled out that the device could contain confidential information.

Mobile IT systems disappeared along with other valuables. It could not be ruled out without a doubt that files were copied or manipulated.\n* There were a number of data leaks in Great Britain, in which confidential documents were disclosed because data storage media were stolen. In one case, several computer hard disks were stolen from the British Air Force which contained personal information, collected by employees for security screening purposes.\n* An employee of a call centre prepared copies of a large set of confidential customer data shortly before he had to leave the company.

Such dependencies can be easily disregarded during planning and trigger impairments during operation.\nIn addition, security problems can arise when tasks, roles or responsibility are not clearly assigned. This may cause, amongst other things, processes to be delayed, security procedures to be neglected or regulations to be disregarded.\nA danger arises when equipment, products, procedures or other means for implementation of information processing are not deployed properly.

The manipulation of such documents is particularly serious because, under certain circumstances, it may take years before the manipulation is noticed and verification will often no longer be possible.\nManipulation of information can be performed when being influenced by the desire for vengeance, to deliberately generate damage or to obtain personal advantages or enrichment, amongst other reasons.\n", "examples": "* An employee was so annoyed at the promotion of her roommate in the accounting department that during the short absence of her colleague, she illegally gained access to her computer. Here she has caused, by changing some figures in the monthly balance sheet, enormous negative impact on the published financial results of the company.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.23 Unauthorised Access to IT Systems", "description": "In principle, each interface of an IT system includes not only the possibility to legally use particular services of this IT system pertaining to this interface, but also the risk of unauthorised access to the IT system via this interface.\n", "examples": "* If a user ID and password have been spied out, any unauthorised use of the applications or IT systems protected by them is well possible.\n* Using inadequately safeguarded remote maintenance access, hackers could gain unauthorised access to IT systems.\n* When interfaces of active network components are inadequately safeguarded, it is possible that an attacker gains unauthorised access to the network component. If they also manage to overcome the local security mechanisms, e.g. obtain administrative privileges, they could perform all administrative activities.\n* Many IT systems have interfaces for the use of interchangeable data storage, such as extra memory cards or USB storage media. In an unattended IT system with the corresponding hardware and software, there is a risk that large amounts of data can be retrieved or malicious software can be introduced this way.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.24 Destruction of Devices or Storage Media", "description": "External and also internal perpetrators can, for different reasons (revenge, malice, frustration), try to destroy equipment, accessories, documents and other data storage media (e.g. DVDs, USB sticks) or similar media. The destruction of data storage media or IT systems can result in significant downtimes for business processes.\nDue to negligence, improper use and also by untrained handling, destruction of devices and data storage media may occur which seriously impairs the operation of IT systems.\nThere is also a risk that, along with destruction, important information will be lost, which cannot be reconstructed at all or only with great effort.\n", "examples": "* In a company an internal perpetrator used his knowledge about an important server being sensitive to too high operating temperatures and blocked the ventilation slits for the power supply fan using an object hidden behind the server. Two days later, the hard drive in the server suffered a temperature-caused defect, and the server was down for several days.\n* An employee was upset about the repeated crashes of his system so much that he let out his anger on his workstation. Here, as the computer was being kicked, the hard drive was so badly damaged that it was useless. The data stored there could only be partially reconstructed from a backup made the previous day.\n* Moisture ingressing into an IT system, due to knocked-over coffee cups or watering the flowers can cause short circuits.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.25 Failure of Devices or Systems", "description": "The failure of a single component of an IT system can lead to a failure of the entire IT operation and hence to the failure of critical business processes. In particular, key components of an IT system for example, servers and network coupling elements, are likely to cause such failures. A failure of individual components of the technical infrastructure, such as air-conditioning or power supply facilities, may contribute to a failure of the entire information network as well.\nThe reason for a failure of an IT system is not always technical malfunction (e.g. T 0.8 Failure or disruption of the power supply). Failures can often be attributed to human error (e.g. T 0.24\nDestruction of devices or storage media) or intentional acts (e.g. T 0.16 Theft of devices, storage media and documents, T 0.41 Sabotage). Also, lack of maintenance, for example due to absence of maintenance personnel, can lead to technical failure. Force majeure (such as fire, lightning, chemical accidents) can also cause damage, but this damage is usually many times higher.\nIf time-critical applications run on an IT system without any alternatives, the consequential damages after a system outage is respectively high.\n", "examples": "* Firmware has been installed on an IT system which is not designed for this type of system. The IT system will then no longer start without errors and must be made operational by the manufacturer.\n* A power failure in a memory system at the site of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) resulted in having to switch it off. Although the actual error could be corrected quickly, the affected IT systems could not start again due to inconsistencies in the file system. As a result, several Web servers operated by the ISP were not available for days.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.26 Malfunction of Devices or Systems", "description": "Devices and systems that serve for information processing, today often have many functions and are therefore of accordingly complex design. This applies generally to both hardware and software components. Due to this complexity, there are many different sources of error in such components. As a consequence, it happens that devices and systems do not function as they were intended to and this gives rise to security problems.\nThere are many causes of malfunctions, such as material fatigue, manufacturing tolerances, design weaknesses, exceeded limits, unintended conditions of use or lack of maintenance for instance.\nSince there are no perfect devices and systems some residual probability of malfunctions must always be accepted.\nA malfunction of a device or system can affect all the basic parameters of information security\n(confidentiality, integrity, availability). In addition, malfunctions may under certain circumstances remain unnoticed for a longer period. It may therefore happen that, for example, calculation results are false and not corrected in time.\n", "examples": "* A blocked ventilation grid causes overheating of a storage system, which does not fail completely, but just malfunctions sporadically after that. It has been noticed only a few weeks later that the information stored there is incomplete.\n* A scientific standard application is used to perform a statistical analysis of previously collected data stored in a database. According to the documentation, the application does not support the database product concerned. The analysis seems to work, spot-checks however show that the calculated results are wrong. The reason for the problem was identified as incompatibility between the application and the database.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.27 Lack of Resources", "description": "If the available resources in a given area are insufficient, bottlenecks may occur in the supply serviced by these resources or even congestion and failures. Depending on the type of resources concerned, even a small event that was actually predicted to happen, can in the end affect a large amount of business processes. Lack of resources may occur in IT operations and communications, but also in other areas of an institution. This can lead to a variety of negative effects if for certain tasks, insufficient personnel, time and financial resources are made available. It can happen, for example, that the necessary roles in projects are not filled with qualified people. If resources such as hardware or software do not sufficiently meet the requirements, under certain circumstances technical tasks cannot be successfully processed.\nPersonnel, time, financial, technical and other shortages in normal operation can often be compensated for, for a limited period however. Under extreme time pressure though, for example in emergency situations, they become even more obvious.\nResources can also be deliberately overloaded, if someone intentionally generates an intense need for a resource and thus provokes an intense and persistent impairment of this resource (see also T\n0.40 Denial of Service).\n", "examples": "* Overloaded electrical wires heat up which, in an unfavourable installation layout, can lead to smouldering.\n* When new applications in the network have higher bandwidth requirements than it was assumed at the time of planning, this can result in loss of availability of the entire network, if the network infrastructure does not scale in an adequate measure.\n* If due to overwork, the administrators only sporadically check the log files of the equipment they administer, possible attacks will not be detected promptly.\n* Web servers can become so overloaded by a large amount of simultaneous incoming requests that controlled access to data is almost impossible.\n* If a company is subject to insolvency proceedings, it may happen that there is no money for urgently needed spare parts or those essential service providers cannot be paid.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.28 Software Vulnerabilities or Errors", "description": "For all software the following applies: the more complex it is, the more likely errors will occur.\nEven after intensive testing, not all errors are usually detected prior to delivery to the customer. If software errors are not detected early, the crashes or errors of the application can result in far-reaching consequences. Examples for this include incorrect calculation results, wrong decisions at management level or delays in the workflow of business processes.\nDue to software vulnerabilities or errors, serious gaps in the security can occur in an application or an IT system or all IT systems networked with it. Such gaps in the security can under certain circumstances be exploited by attackers to introduce malicious software, to access data in an unauthorised manner or to perform manipulation.\n", "examples": "* The most frequent warnings of the Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in recent years were related to security-relevant programming errors. These are errors made during programming of software which allow attackers to misuse it. A large proportion of these errors are caused by buffer overflows.\n* Internet browsers are nowadays an important software component on clients. Browsers frequently do not only access the Internet but are also used for internal web applications in companies and public bodies. This is why software vulnerabilities or errors in browsers can impair information security overall particularly strongly.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.29 Violation of Laws or Regulations", "description": "If information, business processes and IT systems of an institution are insufficiently safeguarded\n(for example, by inadequate security management), this can lead to violations of laws relating to information processing or of existing contracts with business partners. Which laws must be observed there, depends on the type of institution and of its business processes and services.\nDepending on where the sites of an institution are located, a number of national regulations may also have to be observed. The following examples illustrate this:\n* The handling of personal data in Germany is governed by a variety of regulations. These include the Federal Data Protection Act, state data protection laws and a variety of sector-specific regulations also. If during communication between two business divisions, personal data (e.g. medical records) is transmitted unprotected over public networks, this can lead to legal consequences under certain circumstances.\n* The management of a company is obliged to take all reasonable care in their business processes. This includes compliance with recognised security measures. In Germany, various laws are applicable, such as the Act for Corporate Control and Transparency (KonTraG -\nGesetz zur Kontrolle und Transparenz im Unternehmensbereich), the Law on Limited Liability Companies (GmbHG - Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung) or the Stock Corporation Act (AktG - Aktiengesetz), from which corresponding obligations and liabilities for the management or the board of a company can be derived in relation to risk management and information security.\n* Proper processing of payment-relevant information is governed by different laws and regulations. In Germany they include among others, the Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB e.g. \u00a7\u00a7 238 et seq.) and the Tax Code (AO Abgabenordnung). Proper processing of information implies their secure processing, of course. Both must be proven regularly in many countries, for example by auditors as part of the audit of annual accounts. If serious security deficiencies are identified, a positive audit report will not be issued.\n* In many industries (e.g. the automotive industry), it is common that manufacturers commit their suppliers to meet certain quality and safety standards. Analogically, more and more requirements are placed on information security. If a contractor violates contractually regulated security requirements, this can result in penalties and even termination of contracts up to and including loss of business relations.\nFew security requirements arise directly from laws. The legislation generally orientates itself however, on the standards in technology as a common basis for assessment of an achievable security level. If there is no healthy balance between the existing security measures in an institution and the sensitive information in the current state of technology, this can have serious consequences.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 0.30 Unauthorised Use or Administration of Devices and Systems", "description": "Without appropriate mechanisms for entry, admission and access control, unauthorised use of devices and systems virtually can neither be prevented nor detected. The basic mechanism IT systems use for this is user identification and authentication. But even in IT systems with a strong identification and authentication mechanisms, unauthorised access is still conceivable, if the corresponding security features (passwords, chip cards, tokens, etc.) fall into the wrong hands. Also, when assigning and maintaining permissions, many mistakes can be made, for example, if authorisations are granted too liberally or given to unauthorised persons, or if they are not regularly updated.\nWhen granted illegal access to devices and systems, unauthorised persons can intercept confidential information, carry out manipulation or cause disruptions.\nA particularly prominent special case of unauthorised use is unauthorised administration. If unauthorised persons change the configuration or operating parameters of the hardware or software components, severe damage can be the consequence of such action.\n", "examples": "* When examining log files, a network administrator came across inexplicable events occurring on different days but often early in the morning and in the afternoon. After a closer examination, it turned out that a wireless router was not configured properly. People waiting at the bus stop outside the office building have used this access to surf with their mobile devices on the Internet while waiting for the bus.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.31 Incorrect Use or Administration of Devices and Systems", "description": "Incorrect or improper use of devices, systems and applications may affect their security, especially when existing security measures are ignored or circumvented. This often leads to disruptions or failures. Depending on what types of devices or systems are used improperly, confidentiality and integrity of information may also be violated.\nA particularly prominent special case of improper use is the improper administration. Errors in the installation, configuration, service and maintenance of hardware or software components can result in severe damage.\nFor example, too generously granted access rights, easy-to-guess passwords, inadequately protected data storage media containing backups or terminals not being blocked during a temporary absence can lead to security incidents.\nIn the same way, data can also be accidentally deleted or changed due to improper use of IT systems or applications. Confidential information can thus be available the public if, for example, permissions are set incorrectly.\nIf power or network cables are laid unprotected, they can be inadvertently damaged, which can cause an outage. A cable connection can be pulled out when staff or visitors stumble over it.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 0.32 Abuse of Authorisations", "description": "Depending on their roles and tasks, people are granted corresponding entry, admission and access rights. In this way, the access to information is on one hand controlled and monitored, and on the other hand, people are enabled to carry out certain tasks. For example, individuals or groups need specific permissions to use applications or edit information.\nA misuse of privileges occurs when intentionally legally or illegally obtained permissions are used outside of the scope of intended use. The aim is thereby often to gain personal benefit or to harm a specific person or institution.\nIn many cases, due to historical, system-related or other reasons, people have higher or more comprehensive entry, admission and access rights than they need in order to perform their activities. These rights can be misused for attacks under certain circumstances.\n", "examples": "* The finer the granularity of access rights to information, the greater the effort required to keep these permissions up to date. There is therefore a risk that when granting the access rights, too little differentiation is being made among the various roles which facilitates the abuse of authorisations.\n* In various applications, access permissions and passwords are stored in system areas, which can be accessed by other users. This would allow attackers to change permissions or retrieve passwords.\nPersons with too generously granted permissions can be tempted to access files belonging to other users, for instance to read another person's email if certain information there is urgently needed.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.33 Absence of Personnel", "description": "Absence of personnel can have a significant impact on an institution and its business processes.\nStaff may be missing unexpectedly due to illness, accident, death or strike, for example.\nFurthermore, also the predictable personnel absences in cases of leave, training or regular termination of contract must be taken into account, especially if the remaining working time is reduced, for example, by a right to take annual leave. Absences of personnel may as well be caused by an internal realignment of resources.\nIn all these cases, critical tasks may in consequence no longer be performed due to absence of personnel. This is especially critical if the person plays a key role in a business process and cannot be replaced by another person due to lack of expertise. Disruptions in the IT operation may be the result. Thus, other areas and processes of the institution can be substantially impaired.\nA loss of personnel may additionally include a considerable loss of expertise and trade secrets, which makes the subsequent transfer of activities to other people impossible.\n", "examples": "* Due to a prolonged illness, the network administrator of a company remained out of office. In the affected company, initially the network ran flawlessly. After two weeks however, after a system crash, no one was able to fix the problem because there was only one administrator familiar with operation of this network. This led to a network failure which lasted several days.\n* During the vacation of an administrator, the institution needed to access the backup media in backup data safe. The access code to the safe was only changed recently and was only known to that administrator. The data recovery could only be performed after several days, because the administrator was not available earlier due to his vacation.\n* In the event of a pandemic more and more personnel become unavailable in the longer term, either due to the disease or due to the necessary care for relatives or children. Also because of fear of contagion in public transportation or in the institution, some employees remain out of office. As a result, only the most necessary work can be done. The required maintenance of systems, be it the central server or the air conditioning in the computing centre, is not performed any more. Gradually, more and more system failures occur.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.34 Attack", "description": "An attack can constitute a threat to an institution, certain areas of the institution or individuals. The technical possibilities to perpetrate an attack are numerous: throwing bricks, blasts by explosives, use of firearms or arson. Whether and to what extent an institution is exposed to the danger of an attack depends not only on the location and environment of the building but on the institution^s activities and the socio-political climate. Companies and public bodies that operate in politically controversial areas are more at risk than others. Institutions close to the usual demonstration staging areas are more at risk than those in remote locations. To assess the level of threat or when suspecting the threat of politically motivated attacks, criminal investigation authorities or the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation (Bundeskriminalamt) can be consulted.\nIn the case of archives, threat assessment must take into account a special circumstance: they store a large number of documents and data in a relatively small space. This can be, for example, medical records, contracts, deeds or wills. Their destruction can have far-reaching implications, not only for the archive, but also for other users. For example, it may be necessary in such a case, that the lost data must be re-collected or newly recorded with great effort. Under certain circumstances some data will even be irrevocably lost. Attacks on paper-based and electronic archives can therefore cause substantial damage.\n", "examples": "* In the 1980s, a bomb attack was perpetrated on the data centre of a large federal agency in Cologne. Due to the large penetrating power of the explosive device, not only windows and walls, but also many information systems in the data centre were destroyed.\n* In the attack on the World Trade Center in New York on the 11th of September 2001, not only were many people killed but also were a number of IT facilities destroyed. As a result, several companies had considerable difficulty in continuing their business activities.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.35 Coercion, Extortion or Corruption", "description": "Coercion, extortion or corruption may affect the security of information and business processes.\nUsing threats of violence or other detriments an attacker can, for example, try to make the victim disregard security guidelines, or to circumvent security measures (coercion).\nInstead of threatening, attackers can also purposefully offer employees or other person's money or other benefits to make them an instrument for security violations (corruption). For example, there is a risk that a corrupt employee will forward confidential documents to unauthorised persons.\nIn principle, by coercion or corruption, all basic parameters of information security may be affected. Attacks can be aimed at, amongst other things, forwarding confidential information to unauthorised persons, manipulating business-critical information or disrupting the smooth execution of business processes.\nParticular danger exists if such attacks are aimed against high-profile executives or persons in special positions of trust.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 0.36 Identity Theft", "description": "In the case of identity theft, an attacker assumes a false identity, he takes advantage of information about another person, to act on his or her behalf. Here, data such as date of birth, address, credit card or bank account numbers are used in order, for example, to gain access to an Internet provider or to gain financial benefits in other ways. Theft of identity often leads directly or indirectly to damage of reputation, but also elucidating the causes and preventing the negative consequences for those affected is time-expensive. Some forms of identity fraud are also known as masquerade.\nIdentity theft occurs most frequently where identity verification is handled too carelessly, especially if expensive services are based on it.\nA person who has been misled in respect to the identity of his or her communication partner can be easily persuaded to reveal sensitive information.\n", "examples": "* To register with various email providers or auction platforms on the Internet, it sufficed to invent a fictitious name and to provide a suitable address from the phone book with it. At first, attackers could register using recognisable fictitious names, for example, derived from cartoon characters. As stronger plausibility checks were later introduced for this purpose, names, addresses and account numbers of real people have been used. Those affected have only learned about a fraud, when the first claims for payment arrived.\n* The sender address of emails can be easily spoofed. It happens again and again that users are this way fooled into believing that an email comes from a trusted communication partner. Similar attacks are possible by manipulation of caller ID for voice calls or by manipulating the sender identity for fax connections.\n* An attacker may use a masquerade to try to enter into an already existing connection without having to authenticate himself, since this step has already been performed by the original communication participants.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.37 Repudiation of Actions", "description": "People can deny, for various reasons, to have committed certain acts for example, because these acts violate instructions, security guidelines, or even laws. But they could also deny having received a notification, for example because they have forgotten a deadline or an appointment. The field of information security is focused on accountability, a property predestined to ensure that committed acts cannot be denied without justification. Generally the term non-repudiation is used here.\nIn a communication there is a further distinction, whether a communication participant denies the receipt of messages (Repudiation of Receipt) or sending of messages (Repudiation of Origin).\nRepudiating the receipt of messages can be of relevance for, amongst other things, financial transactions when someone denies having received an invoice at a due date. Likewise, it may happen that a communication participant denies sending messages, e.g. denies having issued a purchasing order. Message sending or receiving mail can be repudiated in the case of post messages as well as fax or email messages.\n", "examples": "An urgently needed spare part has been ordered electronically. After a week it is claimed still to be missing, in the meantime high losses due to production outage are incurred. The supplier denies having ever received an order.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.38 Abuse of Personal Data", "description": "Personal data is almost always particularly sensitive information. Typical examples include information about personal or factual circumstances of an identified or identifiable natural person. If the protection of personal data is not sufficiently guaranteed, the danger exists that the person will be impaired in his or her social position or economic conditions.\nAn abuse of personal data takes place if an institution collects, for example, too much personal data, collects it without legal basis or consent, uses it for purposes different from the objective stated at the time of collecting, deletes personal data too late or discloses such data in an unauthorised manner.\n", "examples": "* Personal data may be processed only for the purpose for which it was collected or stored for the first time. It is therefore inadmissible to use log files for attendance and monitoring conduct, if they were designed to store information on users' logging on to an IT system and logging off merely for access control.\n* Persons who have access to personal data could disclose them in an unauthorised manner.\nFor example, an employee at the front desk of a hotel could sell the guests(, registration information to advertising companies.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.39 Malicious Software", "description": "Malicious software is software developed with the aim of performing unwanted and often harmful operations. Typical kinds of malicious software include viruses, worms and Trojan Horses.\nMalicious software is usually active in a secret way without the user's knowledge or consent.\nNowadays, malicious software offers an attacker comprehensive communication and control possibilities, and makes a variety of functions available. Amongst other things, malicious software can purposefully reveal passwords, remote-control systems, deactivate data protection software and spy on data.\nThe most significant damage here is loss or corruption of information or applications. But also the loss of reputation and financial damage, caused by malicious software, are of great importance.\n", "examples": "* In the past, the malicious software W32/Bugbear was spread in two ways: it searched in local area networks for computers with shares, where write access was possible, and made copies of itself on each share found. Moreover, it sent itself as an HTML-email to recipients in the email address books of infected computers. Due to an error in the HTML routines of certain email programs, the malicious software was executed upon opening the message without further action by the recipient.\n* The malicious software W32/Klez spread in different variants. Infected computers sent the virus to all recipients in the email address book of the computer. After this virus had infected a computer, by continuous manipulation of the operating system it prevented the installation of anti-virus programs from most popular manufacturers and made it significantly more difficult to perform disinfection of the infected computers.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.40 Denial of Service", "description": "There are a variety of different forms of attack, all aiming at disruption of the intended use of certain services, functions or devices. The generic term for such attacks is \"Denial of Service\".\nOften the term \"DoS-attack\" is used.\nSuch attacks can come, amongst others, from disgruntled employees or customers, but also from competitors, extortionists or politically motivated perpetrators. The aim of the attacks can be business-relevant values of any kind. Typical forms of DoS attacks are:\n* Disruptions of business processes, for example, by flooding the order processing with improper orders,\n* Damage to the infrastructure, for example by blocking the doors of the institution,\n* provoking IT failures by e.g. purposeful overloading services of a server in the network.\nThis type of attack is often associated with distributed resources, the attacker generates such a high demand for these resources that they are no longer available for the actual users. In IT-based attacks, the following resources can be artificially made scarce: processes, CPU time, memory, disk space and transfer capacity.\n", "examples": "* In spring 2007 in Estonia strong DoS attacks on numerous Internet sites over a prolonged period of time took place. This led to significant impairments in the use of information services and Internet services in Estonia.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.41 Sabotage", "description": "Sabotage is the deliberate manipulation of or damage to objects or processes with the aim of inflicting damage to the victim by acting this way. Particularly attractive targets can be data centres and the communication connections of public bodies or companies, since there a great effect can be achieved with relatively few resources.\nThe complex infrastructure of a computer centre can be affected by selective manipulation, when possibly external perpetrators but also primarily intruders from inside actively influence important components to provoke operational disruptions. In this regard, insufficiently protected technical building systems and communication infrastructure as well as central supply points are particularly threatened if they are left unobserved in organisational and technical terms and can be easily accessed by externals without being noticed.\n", "examples": "* In a mainframe computer centre, a manipulation of the uninterrupted power supply led to a temporary total failure. The perpetrator had repeatedly manually switched the uninterrupted power supply to bypass mode and then manipulated the main power supply of the building. Altogether there were four failures within three years. Even hardware was partially damaged. The disruption took between 40 and 130 minutes.\n* Sanitary facilities were also located within a data centre. Due to blockage of the drains and the simultaneous opening of the water supply, water penetrated into central technology components. Damage caused this way resulted in interruptions of operation in the production system.\n* Electronic archives present a particular risk of sabotage, since there, many sensitive documents are kept on a small floor space. Because of this aspect, by targeted unsophisticated manipulation a great deal of damage can be incurred under certain circumstances.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.42 Social Engineering", "description": "Social engineering is a method to gain unauthorised access to information or IT systems through social action. In social engineering advantage is taken of human qualities such as e.g. helpfulness, trust, fear or respect for authority. As a result, employees can be manipulated so that they act in an inadmissible way. A typical case of attacks with the help of social engineering is the manipulation of people by phone calls where the attacker introduces himself as for example:\n* a secretary whose boss must do something quickly, but has forgotten his password and needs it urgently now.\n* an administrator, calling because of a system error, since he needs the user's password to fix the problem.\nIf such attackers are being asked critical questions in return, the enquirer is supposedly \"just a temporary help\" or an \"important\" personality.\nAnother strategy for systematic social engineering is to develop a longer relationship to the victim. Unimportant but numerous phone calls in advance serve the attacker to gain knowledge and build up confidence that he can make use of later.\nSuch attacks can also be multi-stage attacks, where in further steps knowledge and techniques are used, which have been acquired in the previous stages.\nMany users know that they must not reveal their passwords to anybody. Social engineers know this and therefore must reach the desired aim using other ways. Examples of such are:\n* An attacker can ask the victim, to execute commands or applications unfamiliar to him or her, for example, because this will help to solve an IT problem. This may be a hidden command to change access rights. This allows the attacker to access sensitive information.\n* Although many users are using strong passwords, they are however used for multiple accounts. If an attacker can provide a useful network service (such as an email address system), for which the user must authenticate him or her self, he can get access to the desired passwords and logins. Many users will use the same credentials they chose for this service also for other services.\nIf attackers gain passwords or other authentication features in an unauthorised way, for example by means of social engineering, this is often referred to as \"phishing\" (a portmanteau word from \"password\" and \"fishing\").\nDuring social engineering the attacker is not always visible. Often the victim never recognises that he or she was being exploited. If successful, the attacker does not have to face the risk of legal sanctions and also has a source for obtaining additional information later.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 0.43 Replaying Messages", "description": "In this form of attack, attackers send specially prepared messages to individuals or systems with the aim of gaining an advantage for themselves or to cause damage to the victim. To construct the messages in a proper way, attackers use interface descriptions, protocol specifications, or records logging of the communication behaviour from the past.\nIn practice, there are two important special cases of message replay:\n* In a \"replay attack\" (replay of messages) attackers record valid messages and play this information at a later time almost unchanged. Also only part of a message may suffice, such as a password, to enter into an IT system without authorisation.\n* In a \"man-in-the-middle attack\" the attacker assumes unnoticed a mediating position in the communication among various participants. In general, the attacker pretends here to be the sender of a message to the intended recipient, and he pretends to the recipient that he is the actual sender. If successful, the attacker can receive messages, which are not intended for him, evaluate them and purposefully manipulate them before they are forwarded to the intended recipient.\nAn encryption of the communication does not protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, if no secure authentication of communication partners is performed.\n", "examples": "* An attacker records the authentication data (e.g. user ID and password) during a user^s login and uses this information to gain access to a system. In purely static authentication protocols a password, although if it is transferred in an encrypted way, can be used to illegally access a third party system.\n* To cause financial harm to the employer (company or public body), an employee places an approved purchase order several times.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.44 Unauthorised Entry to Premises", "description": "If unauthorised persons gain illegal entry into a building or individual premises, this can lead to various other dangers. These include theft or manipulation of information or IT systems. In qualified attacks time is crucial, in which the perpetrators can pursue their goal undisturbed.\nOften the perpetrators want to steal valuable IT components or other goods that can be easily sold. However, the target of an intrusion, among other things, can be to gain access to confidential information, perform manipulations or disrupt business processes.\nUnauthorised intrusion into premises can thus result in multiple types of damage:\n* Damage can occur already due to the very entry into property in an unauthorised manner. Windows and/or doors are forced open and hence damaged, they must be repaired or replaced.\n* Stolen, damaged or destroyed equipment or components must be repaired or replaced.\n* Damage due to breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability of information or applications can occur.\n", "examples": "* During a night-time intrusion into an office building the perpetrators did not take a worthwhile trophy. Due to frustration about this, they emptied the powder extinguishers into the offices. The burglary damage was minor, however, the costs of cleaning and work interruptions disproportionately high.\n* A break-in into a company during one weekend caused only minor damage due to levering a window open, only one coffee cup stolen and smaller pieces of furniture taken away. During a routine inspection, however, it turned out later that a central server has been skilfully manipulated exactly at the time of the intrusion.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.45 Data Loss", "description": "Data loss is an event that leads to a situation where stored data cannot be used as required (loss of availability). A common form of data loss occurs when data is inadvertently or illegally deleted, for example by accidental misuse, malfunctions, power outages, pollution or malicious software.\nData loss may also occur due to damage, loss or theft of devices or data storage media. This risk is extremely high in case of mobile terminals and removable data storage media.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that many mobile IT systems are not always online. The data stored on these systems is therefore not always up to date. When data is synchronised between the mobile and stationary IT systems, carelessness or malfunction may lead to loss of data.\n", "examples": "* A PDA falls out of a shirt pocket and shatters into pieces on the tiles, a mobile phone is retrieved by a dog instead of the newspaper, unfortunately with consequences. These and similar events are the causes of many total losses of data on mobile devices.\n* There is malicious software that purposefully deletes data on infected IT systems. Some pests execute the delete function not immediately upon infection, but only when a defined event occurs, for example, if the system reaches a certain date.\n* Many internet services can be used to store information online. If the password is forgotten, and is not stored, it may happen that the stored information cannot be accessed any more if the service provider does not offer a suitable method to reset the password.\n* Hard drives and other storage media have a limited lifetime. If no suitable redundancy measures are undertaken, technical defects may result in loss of data.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 0.46 Loss of Integrity of Sensitive Information", "description": "The integrity of information can be impaired by various causes, such as by manipulation, misconduct of individuals, misuse of applications, software failures of transmission errors.\n* Due to the aging of data storage media, loss of information can occur.\n* During data transfer transmission errors may occur.\n* Malicious software can destroy or modify entire databases.\n* Due to incorrect input, undesired transactions may occur, which often remain unnoticed for a long time.\n* Attackers may try to manipulate data for their purposes, e.g. to gain access to other IT systems or databases.\n* Manipulating the index database can prompt electronic archives to archive or retrieve false documents.\nIf the information loses integrity, it can cause a variety of problems:\n* In the simplest case, information cannot be read and hence further processed.\n* Data can be accidentally or intentionally falsified to the extent that false information is passed on. In this way transfers with wrong amounts, for instance, or to the wrong recipient can be triggered, the sender data in an email can be manipulated and many more.\n* If encrypted or compressed data loses its integrity (in this case it is enough to change just one bit), it cannot be decrypted or respectively decompressed under certain circumstances.\n* The same applies to cryptographic keys, also here changing a single bit can make the keys useless.

Furthermore, foreseeable absences of personnel due to holidays, training programmes, or normal terminations of employment must be taken into consideration, especially when the time the employee is still available for work is shortened due to accrued vacation time, for example.\nIn all cases, one possible consequence is that crucial tasks will not be performed due to the loss of personnel. This is especially critical when the person affected fills a key position in the business process and this person cannot be replaced due to a lack of personnel disposing of the appropriate technical knowledge. This could result in disruptions to IT operations. This may also cause massive disturbances for other departments and processes of the organisation.\nA loss of personnel can also result in a loss of knowledge and confidential information so severe that it becomes impossible to subsequently assign the corresponding tasks to someone else.\n", "examples": "* Due to a prolonged illness, the network administrator of a company was off work. The network of the company he worked for continued to operate without error at first. However, two weeks later the system crashed and no one was able to eliminate the error because this employee was the only one trained in the operation of the network. The result was that the network was unavailable for several days.\n* While an administrator was on holiday, access to the backup tapes stored in the data safe was required for data backup purposes. The access code for the safe had been changed just before that, and the administrator was the only person who knew the new access code. It was only possible to restore the data after several days because it was impossible to reach the administrator any faster while on holiday.\n* If there is a pandemic, more and more personnel will be absent for extended periods of time as the pandemic spreads, be it due to the illness itself, due to the necessity of caring for family members or taking care of children who cannot go to school or kindergarten, or simply due to the fear of becoming infected in public means of transportation or in the organisation. It will only be possible to perform the most essential tasks. The maintenance required for the systems, whether the central server or the air-conditioning system needed in the computer centre, cannot be performed any more. More and more systems will fail as time goes by due to the lack of maintenance.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 1.2 Failure of the IT system", "description": "The failure of one component in an IT system can lead to the failure of the entire IT operation, and therefore to the failure of important business processes. Such failures are especially likely to occur when components that are central to the IT system fail, e.g. LAN servers or network switching elements. Even the failure of individual technical infrastructure components, for example air conditioning or power supply equipment, can contribute to the failure of an entire IT system.\nThe cause of a failure of an IT system is not always due to technical failure (e.g. T 4.1 Disruption of power supply). Failures are also often the result of human error (e.g. T 3.2 Negligent destruction of equipment or data) or deliberate action (e.g. T 5.4 Theft, T 5.102 Sabotage). Even insufficient maintenance, for example due to the absence of maintenance personnel, can lead to technical failures. Damage can also occur as a result of force majeure (e.g. fire, lightning, chemical accidents), although the scale of the damage is likely to be considerably higher in such cases.\nWhen time-critical applications are run on an IT system, the secondary damage resulting from a system failure will be correspondingly high if there are no alternative systems available.\n", "examples": "* Due to voltage spikes in the power supply, the power supply unit of an important IT system is destroyed. Since the IT system concerned is an older model, there is no immediate replacement available. The repairs will take a whole day to finish, and during this time, the entire IT operation is unavailable.\n* Firmware is loaded onto an IT system, but the firmware is not intended for use with this type of system. The IT system will no longer start without errors and has to be returned to an operable state by the manufacturer.\n* A power failure in the storage system of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) resulted in the shutdown of the storage system. Although it was possible to fix the actual error quickly, the IT systems affected would not boot up correctly as there were inconsistencies in the file system. Several of the web servers operated by the ISP remained unreachable for days until all the subsequent problems were finally fixed.\n* In electronic archives, it is possible for the date of first archiving to be misinterpreted as the document creation date if no other authentication procedures, such as time stamping services, are used for verification purposes. This applies in particular to business processes where the electronic archiving of large quantities of document data is integrated transparently into the business process. In one case, failure of an archive component meant that archiving of some of the document data was delayed by a day. Because WORM media were used, the order in which the business documents were physically archived was documented and could therefore be verified.\nHowever, the length of the delay resulting from the failed archived component was not documented. As a result, it appeared during a subsequent audit as if the documents had been tampered with after archiving.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 1.3 Lightning", "description": "Lightning is the most significant threat to a building and the information technology in the building during a thunderstorm. A lightning strike can release current strengths of up to 200,000 amperes at voltages of up to several 100,000 volts. This enormous amount of electrical energy is released and dissipated within 50 to 100 microseconds. A lightning strike of this order of magnitude at a distance of approximately 2 km will still cause voltage spikes in the electrical cables in the building that could lead to the destruction of sensitive electronic devices. The closer the lightning strike is, the greater the indirect damage resulting from the strike.\nIf a building is hit directly by lightning, then damage will be caused by the dynamic energy released by the lightning strike. This can lead to damage to the building structure (roof and fagade), damage caused by subsequent fire, or damage to electrical devices due to overvoltage.\nVarious commercial weather services provide information for a fee on the risk of lightning strikes for different regions. In Germany, such providers include, among others, the National Meteorological Service (Deutsche Wetterdienst at www.dwd.de) or the Lightning Information Service offered by Siemens (BLIDS, www.blids.de).\n", "examples": "* At a large German airport, lightning struck in close proximity to the control tower. In spite of having an external lightning protection system installed (in the form of a lightning rod), the automatic fire extinguishing system was triggered in the IT area, paralysing all airport operations for 2 hours.\n* In addition to direct damage, lightning strikes also have more far-reaching consequences. One often reads reports similar to the following: In April 1999, lightning struck a high-voltage power line near Darmstadt and caused a brief power failure affecting about\n80,000 people.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 1.4 Fire", "description": "In addition to the direct damage caused by a fire to a building or its equipment, there may be consequential damage whose damaging effects, especially to information technology, can reach catastrophic proportions. For example, damage from the water used to fight the fire can occur not only at the immediate site of the fire, but may also be found in the floors of the building below the site of the fire. Burning PVC generates chlorine gases that form hydrochloric acid when they come into contact with moist air and extinguishing water. If the resulting hydrochloric acid vapours are spread via the air conditioning system, then sensitive electronic devices located in a part of the building far away from the site of the fire can become damaged. However, even \"normal\" smoke generated by a fire and spread by the air conditioning system can cause damage to the IT equipment.\nFires can be started by careless handling of sources of fire (e.g. unattended open flames, welding and soldering work, etc.), but also through improper use of electrical equipment (e.g. unattended coffee machines, overloaded power strips). Technical defects in electrical devices can also start a fire.\nThe following factors can help spread a fire, among other factors:\n* Keeping doors separating fire zones open using wedges,\n* Improper storage of flammable material (e.g. waste paper),\n* Failure to observe relevant standards and regulations for preventing fires,\n* Absence of fire detection and alarm systems (e.g. smoke detectors),\n* Missing or unusable hand-held fire extinguishers or automatic extinguishing equipment (e.g.\ngas extinguishing systems),\n* Poor fire prevention measures (e.g. the absence of fire seals in cable trays or the use of unsuitable insulation materials for heat and noise insulation).\n", "examples": "* In the early 1990s, a mainframe computer centre near Frankfurt suffered catastrophic fire damage that lead to its complete failure.\n* Small electrical appliances such as coffee machines and table lamps are frequently installed improperly or in the wrong place, and can then cause fires.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 1.5 Water", "description": "The uncontrolled flow of water into buildings or rooms can be caused by the following, for example:\n* Rain, high water, flooding,\n* Disruptions to the water supply or sewer system,\n* Defects in the heating system,\n* Defects in air conditioning systems connected to a water supply,\n* Defects in sprinkler systems,\n* Extinguishing water used to fight a fire,\n* Sabotage using water, for example by turning on the water taps and blocking the drains.\nRegardless of how the water enters a building or room, there is a danger that it will damage the supply systems or IT components or put them completely out of operation (short-circuits, mechanical damage, rust, etc.). If central building supply system equipment (main distributors for the electrical, telephone, or data systems) is installed in rooms in the basement not equipped with automatic water drainage equipment, then water entering these rooms can cause large amounts of damage.\n", "examples": "* Many businesses, even large companies, do not take the danger of flooding seriously enough. For example, one company was \"surprised\" several times by flood damage to their computer centre. The computer centre was literally washed away twice within 14 months. The resulting damage was estimated to be several hundred thousand euros and was not covered by insurance.\n* In a server room, a water pipe was routed under the ceiling and then enclosed with plasterboard. A leak arose in one of the water pipe connections, but the leak was not detected promptly. -The water that escaped formed a pool at the lowest point of the plasterboard enclosure first before it escaped from there, causing a short-circuit in a power distributor located beneath it. -The result was that both the water and the power supply of the affected part of the building had to be switched off completely until the repair work was finished.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 1.6 Burning cables", "description": "When a cable catches fire, either by spontaneous ignition or exposure to flames, there can be a variety of consequences:\n* When the wire insulation is destroyed, short circuits and arcing can occur, which then triggers the corresponding protection devices (circuit breaker or fuse) and disrupts the supply of power.\n* Individual wires or the entire cable can break and disconnect. Especially critical is when only the ground conductor (PE) is broken while the live wires (L and N) are still in operation. The protective measures will have no effect in this case. An immediate threat is when the PEN conductor fails in a TNC network. The housings of Protection Class 1 devices would suddenly be live in this case. This obviously results in a shock hazard.\n* Aggressive gases can form. Such gases can be corrosive and adversely affect the IT and communications equipment. They can also be toxic and lead to personal injury (e.g. poisoning). Corrosive gases can also attack structural components of the building in the concrete walls and floors, causing problems with the statics of the building when repairing the damage done by the burning cables.\n* Cables which do not have fire-resistant or self-extinguishing insulation material may help to spread the fire. Even fire sealing cannot prevent this completely and merely delays the spreading of the fire.\n* In tightly packed cable trays, smouldering fires can ignite and remain undetected for a long time, causing the fire to spread long before the fire breaks out openly. The conductivity of a cable decreases as it gets warmer, which in turn increases the loop resistance. This can generate additional heat that then promotes the continuation of the critical processes.\nBurning cables often only cause a slight increase in the temperature while the fire is forming. This then creates a risk of generating significant amounts of \"cold\" smoke before the smoke detectors mounted on the ceiling are triggered.\n", "examples": "* In an administrative building, the existing electrical cables were not replaced for cost reasons and were instead overloaded, in spite of knowing better. The necessary modifications were not made as the staff was expecting to relocate soon to a new administrative building.\n* The overloaded lines heated up, and because they were packed so tightly together, heat accumulated and then caused a smouldering fire. The fire was only discovered after the lines failed due to the intense heat. It took several days to restore the workstations affected by the fire to proper operating condition again.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 1.7 Inadmissible temperature and humidity", "description": "Every device has a defined temperature range within which its proper functioning is guaranteed. A rise or fall in the room temperature to a value outside that range could result in operational malfunctions or equipment failures.\nFor example, the equipment located in a server room converts electrical energy to heat, causing the temperature in the room to rise. If the ventilation is inadequate, the operating temperature of the devices may exceed the permissible upper limit. When the sun is shining into a room, it is possible for the temperature in the room to exceed 50\u00b0C.\nThe windows in a server room are frequently opened for ventilation purposes. During seasons in which the outside temperature varies greatly (in the spring or autumn), open windows can cause large temperature fluctuations, and humidity levels may exceed the permissible upper limit due to the sudden drop in temperature.\nExcessive fluctuations in temperature or excessive humidity in areas where long-term digital storage media are stored can cause data errors and reduce the useful storage life of the media. Some manufacturers specify optimal storage conditions for long-term storage media with temperatures of\n20-22\u00b0C and 40% humidity. Even analogue storage media such as paper or microfilm require certain storage conditions. For example, if paper is stored at a location where the humidity is too high, the paper may become mouldy or brittle.\n", "examples": "* In a government agency in Bonn, the entire control and evaluation electronics of a security system were installed in a room in which there was only just enough space left after installation to open the doors of the equipment cabinets. For security reasons, the doors to both the cabinets and the room were solid doors.\n* The system functioned smoothly after installation was complete in the autumn, but the following summer, inexplicable malfunctions occurred. These were soon followed by total system crashes for which there was no obvious cause. Several days of troubleshooting, involving a lot of time and effort in terms of technology and manpower and carried out with the doors open, yielded no results. It was only by accident that the cause of the problems, the overheating of the system whenever the outside temperature rose above 30\u00b0C, was finally identified, and the problems were successfully eliminated by installing an air conditioning system.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 1.8 Dust, soiling", "description": "Despite the increasing use of electronics in IT, information technology still relies on mechanical components.

The failure of the processor fan caused the server to crash sporadically. Eventually, the power supply unit fan failed as well, causing the power supply unit to overheat and short-circuit, which in turn resulted in the total failure of the server.\n* To hang a wall panel in an office, holes were drilled into the wall by the building services personnel. The employee left his office for a short time so the work could be done. When he returned to his workplace, he discovered that his PC did not work any more.

Therefore, the quality of the communication connections may differ.\nThe reasons for a failure of a WAN may be manifold. Thus, it is possible that a failure of a WAN only affects individual users, a provider, or a certain region. Often, such failures only entail brief disturbances, but there are also frequently longer failures that may result in other, dramatic problems.\nThe way a WAN fails plays a role if time-critical applications are operated on IT systems interconnected by means of WANs.

These threats include, for example, damaging environmental conditions such as excessively high or low temperatures as well as dust and moisture. Other problems resulting from the portability of the devices include, for instance, damage caused during transport.\nAnother important aspect of mobile data media and devices is that they are also used in areas which have different levels of security. In some environments, the user knows which level of security is provided, but may not in others. In addition to portability, the ability to communicate with other IT systems is also a reason why PDAs, laptops, and other mobile devices are used. For this reason, the problems that could be caused by interacting with other IT systems must also be taken into consideration. The trustworthiness of the IT systems in the organisation itself can be estimated to a certain extent, but it is difficult to estimate the trustworthiness of an unknown environment.\nCommunication with unknown IT systems and networks always poses a potential threat to your mobile system, its applications, and its data. When establishing contact with other IT systems, for example, computer viruses or Trojan horses can also be transmitted.\nWhen returning with mobile data media and IT systems, it is therefore always necessary to ask where the USB stick, PDA, or laptop has been and to follow the corresponding precautions.\nAnother problem arising when using external infrastructures, for example when downloading information at trade shows, is lack of transparency frequently encountered in the services offered..\nMany service providers collect customer data to create profiles so, on the one hand, they can offer services that are better tailored to their customers, but also so they can sell this data to other providers. For example, profiles could be created solely by evaluating the information on where the user was and how the user communicates (which services are used when, how often, and with whom). Even applications that run entirely on the mobile end device may collect data (e.g. on the frequency and type of use) and then send the data as soon as the device goes online.\nMobile data media and devices are lost or stolen all the time.

This seriously damaged the reputation of the bank as a result.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.1 Lack of, or insufficient, rules", "description": "The application of universal organisational rules and specifications for information security objectives become more and more important as the scale of information processing and the protection requirements for the information to be processed increase.\nThe scope of the rules can be very wide, ranging from questions of areas of responsibility to the distribution of control functions. Examples of the consequences of insufficient or non-existent rules are described in the other threats presented in Threat Catalogue T2.\nIt is often the case that the existing rules are not modified accordingly after technical, organisational or personnel changes having a significant impact on information security have been made. Outdated rules can impede smooth IT operations. Problems can also arise from rules that are formulated incomprehensibly or without any context, resulting in misunderstood rules.\nThe following examples clearly illustrate how insufficient or non-existent rules can lead to damage:\n* Poor resource management can seriously impair the scheduled flow of operations in a computer centre, for example simply because an order for printer paper was forgotten.\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers need to be maintained regularly after purchase to ensure that they are also ready for use in case of fire.\n* After a flood on one floor, water damage was detected in the Server room one floor below as well. Due to inadequate key management, the damage caused by the water in the Server room could not be repaired immediately because no one knew where the key to the Server room was at the time. This resulted in significantly more water damage.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.2 Insufficient knowledge of rules and procedures", "description": "The specification of rules alone does not ensure they will be followed, nor does it ensure trouble-free operations.

This could also result in confidential data accidentally getting into the hands of unauthorised persons.\n* In a federal agency, differently coloured waste paper bins were used with one colour intended for the disposal of the documents to be destroyed. Most of the employees were not informed of this colour scheme.\n* In a federal agency, there were numerous rules for performing data backups which were agreed to verbally over time between the IT Security Officer and the IT department. Upon enquiry, it turned out that the employees concerned knew nothing about the \"agreements\" and had no one to contact in case of questions. The rules regarding data backups were not documented either. As a result, many users made backups of the local data on their workstation computers even though continuous data backups were only supposed to be performed centrally on the servers.\n* In a computer centre, a new rule was introduced stating that in the event of problems with the burglar detection or fire alarm systems, the gatehouse should also be manned at night. The security guard service was not informed of this new rule by the security officer responsible for this. As a result, the computer centre was insufficiently protected at night for several weeks.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.3 Lack of, inadequate, incompatible resources", "description": "Not providing enough resources may significantly disrupt operation.

Therefore, the IT procedure which is supposed to use this connection cannot be put into operation until the connection is activated.\n* An example of an unsuitable resource includes a complex and time-critical application, e.g. a graphic-intensive CAD application, which is then to be installed on a computer that is not powerful enough.\n* An example of incompatible resources includes printer connection cables with varying pin assignments.\n* Due to the numerous ways of exchanging data between two IT systems, it is often the case that both computers have at least three different interfaces for exchanging data, which are unfortunately not compatible. Typical questions to be asked prior to each data exchange include, for example: diskette, CD-ROM, DVD, USB stick, or Bluetooth?\n* A new version of the operating system is to be installed on the workstation PCs. However, some of the existing hardware components cannot be used with the new operating system because no driver support is offered for them in the new version of the operating system.\n* The memory space of the hard disks of PCs and servers, as well as on mobile data media is constantly increasing. Unfortunately, people often neglect to purchase IT components and data media with enough capacity for use as regular backup media.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.4 Insufficient monitoring of security safeguards", "description": "After introducing safeguards to help achieve information processing security (e. g. classification of information, data backup, access control, rules regarding the conduct during emergencies), it is also necessary to ensure they are implemented consistently. If the security measures are not monitored or monitoring is inadequate, then it is impossible to determine whether the security measures are being followed or are proving effective. This impedes the ability to react to the respective situation in a timely and appropriate manner.\nIn addition, there are some security measures the effectiveness of which can only be seen when appropriate controls are implemented. For example, these include logging functions the security properties of which only become apparent when the logged data is analysed.\n", "examples": "* In order to prepare crimes, the lock cylinders in the outside doors and gates are often replaced by unauthorised persons. Accesses that are rarely used or intended for use as emergency exits only are often just checked to ensure that they open freely in in the direction of egress within the framework of patrols. The function of the lock cylinders is often left unchecked.\n* In a government agency, some of the Unix servers are used for external data communications. Due to the primary importance of these IT systems, the security policy specifies that the integrity of all Unix servers must be checked weekly. Since no one controlled on a regular basis whether or not these checks were actually performed, it only became apparent during the investigation of a security incident that the IT department was not performing the integrity checks. The reason given for not performing the checks was insufficient personnel in the department.\n* In one company, the z/OS Security Auditor position was not filled and left unoccupied. As a result, the RACF configuration settings stopped meeting the security requirements of the company over time. Only after a production failure did the company notice that some users had more rights than required for their jobs. One of these users accidentally stopped an application that was important to production.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.5 Inadequate or non-existent maintenance", "description": "The operability of the technology used must be ensured consistently.

As a result, the UPS system can no longer ensure the supply of power for a sufficiently long period when there is a power failure.\n* Due to a lack of maintenance, the pressure of the fire extinguishers drops to a point where their fire-fighting capability cannot be guaranteed any more.\n* A laser printer fails due to overheating because a ventilation grill was not cleaned properly.\n* Many devices in a server room generate heat. If it is the middle of summer, with the correspondingly high temperatures, and the air conditioning is inadequate (because it is defective or there is no air conditioning at all, for example) for the room, some of the devices may fail due to overheating when it is hot outside.

This also includes the technology distribution rooms containing central components such as power distributors, network switching elements, and servers.\nUnauthorised persons can cause damage deliberately (e.g. through manipulation or vandalism), but also inadvertently due to human error (due to a lack of skills or the knowledge required, for example). Even when there is apparently no immediate damage, operations can still be disrupted if it is necessary to examine how such an event was possible or whether or not damage occurred or data or devices were manipulated.\nIntruders could have, for example, reset passwords, accessed the servers directly, or manipulated active network components. In addition, they could have stolen or altered sensitive information stored on paper or on data media.\nNot only the rooms on the company premises must be protected against unauthorised access, but also the rooms in private homes used for company purposes. Safeguards against burglary (e.g.\nlockable window handles, security locks, and locking bolts and safety glass on entry doors) are often not implemented in home workplaces due to the cost. This results in less protection against break-ins at the telecommuter workplaces than at the company or government agency.\n", "examples": "* The entire central IT of a company was installed in a single Server room equipped with a restrictive and modern access authorisation system. In the summer, though, the company realised that the air conditioning capacity was not sufficient for handling the numerous IT systems. For this reason, the window and doors were opened wide on hot days to cool the room down. A short time later, a new server that had not yet been activated disappeared without a trace.\n* An employee had set up an office at home in a separate room for telecommuting but did not always lock the door. Once, while the children were briefly unsupervised, they began playing in the unlocked home office. The children then used important documents to draw on. In addition, the openings on the computer were stuffed with toys and crackers, which lead to a total failure of the IT system.\n* In one company, every employee was allowed to enter all of the printer rooms. This allowed an attacker to physically access a central printer and then reconfigure it. The new configuration copied all documents to be printed to the integrated hard disk of the printer and did not delete them after printing. Once the hard disk was full, the attacker replaced the full hard disk with an empty one and examined the full hard disk on his computer.\nAlthough the attacker was not employed in the development department, he was able in this manner to copy a number of important development documents without being noticed and then sell them to the competition before the source of the leak was found.\n* A person substituting for a regular member of the cleaning staff who was on holiday took it upon herself to clean the computer centre even though she was not instructed to do so. She then opened the emergency exit, which was monitored by an alarm, and correspondingly triggered a false alarm.\n* After a break-in in an office building, it initially appeared as if only the coffee cash box and two new laptops were missing. In spite of this, all files needed to be examined to check if important parts were missing, and all IT systems needed to be checked for unauthorised access.\n* Access protection can also fail when present but insufficient.

Due to the uncontrolled removal of the media from the archive, the inventory list of the data media archive was not updated and the tapes could not be located during this time.\n* An employee became ill. A colleague working in the same room as the employee knew where he stored the note with his password written on it based on past observations and used it to gain access to the other employee's computer. Since he recently overheard in a telephone conversion that the employee still needed to hand in an expert opinion report, he took over this task in the name of the other employee without authorisation even though he was not up-to-date on the subject matter of the report.

Only after conducting a random plausibility check it was discovered that an inexplicably larger number of DVDs had been used the past six months. After questioning the employees, it was discovered that many employees used these DVDs to record small amounts of data for data exchange purposes.

Such changes can include the addition or relocation of an employee, an employee moving to a different office, the purchasing of new hardware or software, or a company supplying operating resources declaring bankruptcy. The fact that inadequate consideration of the necessary organisational changes can result in corresponding threats is indicated by the following examples:\n* Due to changes made to the construction of a building, the existing escape routes were changed. Since the employees were not adequately informed of the altered escape routes, it becomes impossible to evacuate the building in the required time.\n* Due to changes to an IT procedure, larger amounts of printer paper are required. Since the purchasing office was not informed of this, bottlenecks arose during live IT operations.\n* Electronic documents or files are not automatically checked for malicious software upon reception because a corresponding anti-virus software is not available.\n* When transmitting an electronic document, no one checked if the document was sent in a data format that could be read by the recipient.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.10 Data media are not available when required", "description": "Correct use of data media is of particular importance to many business processes and IT procedures.

If it becomes necessary to reconstruct the data, there will be significant delay because it is impossible to retrieve the tapes immediately.\n* Backup tapes containing different data are accidentally labelled identically. The archive administrator inadvertently releases the most recent tape for deletion. As a result, only an outdated backup is available.\n* Tape administration systems in the z/OS operating system use batch jobs to identify data backup tapes whose expiration dates have been reached so that they can be released for overwriting. If such a batch job crashes or is unable to start, then there may not be enough empty tapes (scratch tapes) for subsequent backups, and tape processing bottlenecks could arise.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.11 Insufficient route dimensioning", "description": "When planning networks, server rooms or computer centres, the mistake of basing the functionality, capacity, or technical security design on the current requirements only is made quite frequently.\nThis approach fails to take account of the facts that:\n* the capacities of the network and computers will have to be expanded as the volume of data increases or new services are added,\n* changes in technical standards may make architectural or technical security modifications necessary.\n* the network will need to be expanded often as the operational requirements change,\n* new requirements imposed on a network may make it necessary to lay new cables.\n", "examples": "* Networks can only be expanded to the extent permitted by the existing cables installed and by the amount of space available for additional cables. Especially in closed cable routes (conduits, screed-covered underfloor channels, etc.), it is often impossible to pull additional cables through without damaging the new or old cables, even there is still space available. The only alternative in this case is to pull the existing cables out of the trays and re-install all cables, both old and new, at the same time. The resulting costs and disruptions to operations can be considerable.\n* In the early planning stages for a computer centre, the only criteria considered were aesthetic aspects. Infrastructural and technical security requirements were given less priority and were only specified after the basic construction work was complete. The completion of the building was delayed extensively because because routes that were required were not available and the size and positioning of individual rooms did not match the requirements. Changes during later operations were very difficult to implement.\n* After ten years of operation, one company planned a completely new network structure and new IT cabling. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the replacement of the telecommunications system and its cabling, which up to now had followed the same routing as the IT cabling, was planned for the following year.

In particular, when cable conduits are built or cables are laid during the concrete construction phase, cables may change position while the concrete is being poured due to changes in the surrounding system. Chaotic cabling is often found in gypsum board stud constructions. When cables and lines are installed in floors or ceilings, geometric or direct cable routing can be selected. Random cable routes are also possible, in which case it may be impossible to determine where cables are routed in the floors and ceilings based on the location of the electrical equipment (lamps, switches, tanks, etc.).

The hardware, software, and installation errors not detected due to non-existent or inadequate software testing and release procedures pose a significant threat to IT operations.\nWhen it is assumed that new hardware or software can be installed without any problems, it is often forgotten that the cost of the possible damage is much higher than the cost of implementing proper test and release procedures. Programs or IT systems are tested inadequately and still contain errors when they are integrated into the production environment. Consequently, the errors will have a disruptive effect on operations that were working smoothly up until this point in time.\nExamples of such damages are described in the following:\n* Programs or program updates cannot be used effectively since more resources (e.g. main memory or processor capacity) than expected are required to obtain an acceptable processing rate. If this is not detected during testing, the result may be a significant waste of investment or possibly even a need to make a significant additional investment. Decisions to save money instead of investing in more resources often resulted in IT systems or applications which had been ordered and paid for but never used.\n* The installation of new software significantly impairs the ability of users to perform routine workflows. The benefits expected from installing the program are delayed until much later, because the employees were not trained and/or informed about the new functions available in the program in advance.\n* The installation of an update for a standard DBMS software package that contains errors means the database may not be available any more or some data may be lost.\n* Some software products install the Microsoft Server Desktop Engine (MSDE) as a database without the user even noticing this. The Microsoft Server Desktop Engine is a version of the Microsoft SQL Server and comes in conjunction with the typical threats posed by a database system. In many cases, the users of the product and the administrators who install the product are not adequately informed of these threats, and they correspondingly fail to implement the necessary security-related safeguards. In most cases when MSDE is used, a user account is created in the database for the administrator that is not provided with any form of password protection in the basic installation. In this manner, an attacker may gain full access to the data, and possibly even to the operating system.\n* In a bank, the operating systems of numerous network components were updated.

This resulted in considerable delays whenever the government agency subsequently tried to expand the network (see also T 2.12 Insufficient documentation on cabling).\n* In a z/OS installation, automatic batch jobs were started every evening to process application data. The batch jobs needed to be run in the correct order for proper processing of the data. When the automation failed one evening, the jobs had to be started manually. Due to a lack of documentation, the batch jobs were started in the wrong order. This caused abnormal terminations during the processing of the application data, resulting in production delays of several hours.\n* Missing data sheets for (volatile) semiconductor memory such as SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) may result in the incorrect deletion of data from such memory, and therefore in the disclosure of confidential information.\n* A company wanted to take some USB sticks (non-volatile memory) out of service.

If the disk space of a user is exhausted, the user will not be able to store any more information. Depending on how the affected IT systems are partitioned, this may affect numerous users and applications.

If application-specific data is not stored on physically separate hard disks, then the failure of a single hard disk could result in the complete failure of all applications.\n* Access to certain data may be impossible due to incorrect parameter settings.\n* Due to an incorrect country setting in the database software, it may be impossible to display certain special characters.\nFaulty database concept\nIn the database concept, the relationships between the tables are shown in addition to the individual tables and their columns and keys.\nAn element in a table may be related to one or more elements in another table, or to none of the elements in any of the other tables. These relationships lead to restrictions that need to be maintained when executing delete, update, or insert operations to maintain the integrity of the database.\n## Example:\n* Every resident must have a place of residence. A resident can have more than one place of residence, though. When a resident dies, it no longer needs a place of residence. Several residents may also share a place of residence. A place of residence can also be empty.\nIn the database, such a relation is shown in an additional table that contains keys for each element in the relation (for the resident/place of residence relation in the example) that refer to the corresponding records in the individual tables. If a record is deleted from the table of residents or the table of places of residence, then there must not be any more references to this record in the table used to associate the residents to the places of residence. Such conditions can be defined in the database itself, using conditions in program statements, or using automatic procedures.\nThe interaction of such constructions can lead to cascading database operations, but such operations are limited in various DBMSs using various restrictions.\nMissing relations between individual tables can lead to a loss of the referential database integrity when this functionality is not implemented in the application.\n## Examples:\n* A place of residence is deleted without checking if other residents are still assigned to this place of residence.\n* The incorrect use of database triggers can lead to inconsistencies in the data if the application does not take these triggers into account.\n* A resident dies and is therefore deleted from the database. -After the delete operation has been completed, a delete trigger deletes all places of residence records of the deceased resident from the additional table used to relate places of residence to residents.\n* A poor concept of how to use database triggers properly can lead to a loss of integrity of the data or to uncontrolled changes to the data.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.40 Complexity of database access", "description": "The users access one or more databases through a database management system (DBMS). This access is obtained directly by the user or through an application. In order to guarantee the integrity of a database, all database accesses must be controlled from a central location.

This can lead to a number of problems, including the destruction of the database.\nNote: The use of data warehouses, online analytic processing (OLAP) systems, and query tools to grant users data access rights often creates security conflicts. On the one hand, the decision-makers want to use as many data as possible from heterogeneous sources of data for evaluation purposes, but on the other hand, sensitive data needs to be protected against unauthorised access. The challenge is to design the access rights in such a way that they meet both the requirements in the field of data privacy and the requirements regarding the confidentiality of sensitive data, as well as the analysis requirements.\nRemote access\n* If access to the database is provided over a network, inadequate security precautions for remote access to the database may lead to manipulated data or the unauthorised reading of data (see also T 5.64 Manipulation of data or software in database systems).\nDatabase queries\n* If the access rights of the various user groups are not restricted only to the level necessary to perform the corresponding tasks, the result may be the loss of the confidentiality of data requiring protection due to unauthorised access.\n* The queries and calls sent to the database by users or applications must use a jointly agreed syntax or the default scope of the query language functionality provided by the DBMS to be accessed (e.g. ANSI SQL 99 for a relational database). If the entity placing the query does not abide by this syntax, it is possible that the DBMS is not be able to process database queries and rejects any further queries. This threat is particularly high when DBMSs from different providers are used and data is accessed from a single main application.\n* The use of imprecisely formulated database queries may lead to the return of incorrect or unexpected results for the database query after changes have been made to the database objects.

The order of the fields returned in this case is determined by the technical structure of the table. Adding or deleting a field from the table, i.e. changing the technical structure of the table, can have potentially fatal effects on an application such a database query is used in.\n* Queries returning vast amounts of data are deliberately sent to the database to prevent access to the database (see T 5.65 Denial of services in a database system).\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.41 Poor organisation of the exchange of database users", "description": "If several users of a database share the same workstation, then there is a risk of accidental or deliberate manipulation of the data when there is no procedure provided for switching users or the switch is not executed properly.

In this case, the logging mechanisms of the database are also undermined since they record the activities of the users and modifications to data by the currently active user ID.

In order to be able to use the communication procedure concerned, the manufacturers are forced to use proprietary implementations due to the missing or only partially present standards.\nThese kinds of incompatibility problems may occur if existing networks are complemented by active network components of other manufacturers or if networks are installed with network components of different manufacturers.\nIf active network components with different implementations of the same communication procedure are operated jointly in the same network, the availability of the entire network, of individual sub-areas, or of certain services may be lost. Depending on the type of incompatibility, two cases can be differentiated:\n* No communication is possible using the related components in the event of non-interoperable implementations of a communication procedure.\n", "examples": "* ATM components may use different signalling protocols, e.g. according to UNI (User Network Interface) version 3.0 and UNI version 3.1, that are not interoperable.\n* Specific services may be implemented differently even on active network components which are theoretically interoperable. As a consequence, the services concerned are not available at all or not available in the entire network, although communication using these components is possible.\n* There are proprietary implementations of redundant LAN emulation servers for ATM networks. For example, if an ATM network consists of two ATM switches, one of which disposes of such a proprietary implementation while the other does not, communication via LANE (LAN emulation) is possible, but the service implemented proprietarily cannot be used.\nHowever, the combination of incompatible passive network components may also endanger the availability of a network. For example, twisted pair cables may be designed with 100 and 150\nOhms, at which these designs must not be used together without a corresponding compiler. An inappropriate combination of active and passive network components may also have negative effects on availability, for example if a network access protocol is operated on a medium not defined for this.

Otherwise, confidential data of a work group may be read by other, unauthorised network subscribers. Seen from this angle, the confidentiality may also be lost by relocating participants of work groups or the entire work group if it is not possible to configure and/or change new confidential areas in the network. This threat affects the integrity of the network and/or the integrity of network segments in a similar way.\n", "examples": "* If new applications are operated on the network which have higher bandwidth requirements than those taken into consideration in the planning phase, this may quickly result in a loss of availability of the entire network if it is no longer possible to sufficiently scale the network infrastructure as a consequence of conceptual deficiencies (loss of availability due to overload). Depending on the selected segmentation of the network, the loss of availability may also only affect individual segments of the network.\n## Example: Networks which have grown according to demand, which can still be found frequently today, often contain backbone segments with a low maximum bandwidth for historical reasons, e.g. token ring or Ethernet segments. This restriction of the speed in the backbone segment affects the availability of the entire network in the event of a high additional load.\n* Networks only suitable for connecting proprietary systems may also cause a loss of availability if systems not suitable for the network are connected to the network (loss of availability due to non-interoperable network components).\n## Example: Networks that are not system-neutral can predominantly be found in mainframe environments for networking the mainframes with the related terminals. Frequently, these are networks installed for terminal or printer operation and not suitable for operating other architectures (e.g. Ethernet). This applies both to the cabling used and the active network components. If this is nevertheless attempted, the proprietary network will no longer be available in general. An option for integrating two architectures may include connection via a gateway.\n* When using active network components not designed for the use of certain protocols, it may not be possible to use any additionally required services or protocols.\n## Example: In a network exclusively consisting of active network components which only support IP routing or IP switching, no Novell Netware network operating system can be operated based on SPX/IPX.\n* When using passive network components which entail a restriction to the network access protocols to be operated on them, it may no longer be possible to scale the network in the future.\n## Example: No ATM may be used in a network designed exclusively using 50 Ohm coaxial cables. No 100 Ohm Ethernet components can be operated on networks designed with 150 Ohm twisted-pair cables. The conceptual deficiencies, which sometimes have historical reasons, among others, result in cost-intensive changes to the network infrastructure.\nNetworks may be designed in an application-, system-, or service-neutral manner, but due to a very heterogeneous component landscape they may require support that cannot be provided by the operating personal any more. This may cause a loss of the availability of the network if malfunctions or failures of passive or active network components cannot be eliminated quickly enough due to a lack of personnel resources.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.46 Exceeding the maximum allowed cable/bus length or ring size", "description": "Depending on the cable type, the topology, and the transmission methods, the corresponding standards provide for maximum cable and/or bus lengths and maximum ring sizes in order to guarantee the functionality of the network according to this standard. Excessive cable, bus, or ring lengths prolong the signal runtimes beyond the extent designed for the corresponding transmission method, and so the availability of the respective network segment or the communication bandwidth is reduced.\nThe occurring phenomena depend on the access method:\n* With the network segments that use the access method CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection), all terminal devices access with equal rights although the medium can only be used exclusively by one terminal device in each case. For this, every terminal device initially checks whether the medium is available for use (carrier sense). If this is the case, the corresponding terminal device starts the transmission. If this happens simultaneously on several terminal devices (multiple access), a collision occurs, which is detected by the sending terminal devices (collision detection) and results in a repetition of the check as to whether the medium is available, including subsequent repeated transmission.\nIf the maximum defined signal runtime on the medium is exceeded, collisions may not be detected in the designed interval (collision detection). This means that a terminal device has already begun transmitting data, while another terminal device still considers the transmission medium to be available. In this case, so-called late collisions occur, rendering the corresponding data packet useless and blocking the medium excessively depending on the length of the data packet. The transmission bandwidth available on the medium may be limited significantly as a result. Normally, a loss of information does not occur due to the protection of the network access protocol despite the loss of individual data packets. For example, Ethernet or Fast Ethernet use the CSMA/CD transmission method.\n* Transmission methods based on the token passing procedure use a specific data packet (the so-called token) in order to define the terminal device which is allowed to occupy the medium. If a terminal device captures the token, it takes control of the medium and passes the token to the next terminal device depending on the implemented token passing procedure. This guarantees that only a single device has control over the medium at any one time.\nSynchronous data transmission at a constant bit rate is essential for network segments operating a token passing procedure. If the medium is not available, the corresponding intervals for the different bits are used for transmitting the data packets; once the medium is available, the intervals are used for passing the token. If the maximum admissible signal runtime is exceeded, the constant bit rate designed for the corresponding transmission method cannot be complied with any more and so communication fails. For example, token ring or FDDI are based on the token passing procedure.\nAlong with a prolongation of the signal runtime, longer cables increase dampening. If the cable lengths exceed the corresponding standard, the dampening caused by the cable may reach levels that make any differentiation of the different signal levels according to the definitions in the standard impossible. In this case, communication using the corresponding wires or glass fibres cannot be guaranteed along their entire length.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.47 Insecure transport of files and data media", "description": "The transportation of documents, data media, or files between the organisation and other locations, for example a home workplace, poses the following risks:\n* They could be lost somewhere along the transportation route * They could be stolen somewhere along the transportation route * They could be read or manipulated somewhere along the transportation route * They could be given to the wrong recipient\nThe destruction, loss of confidentiality, or manipulation of such items can cause serious damage, especially when there is only one copy of the corresponding item.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.48 Inadequate disposal of data media and documents at the home workplace", "description": "If data media or documents are not disposed of properly, it is possible under certain circumstances to extract information from them that should not fall into the hands of third parties.\n", "examples": "* Attackers do not always need to devise complicated technical attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in IT systems in order to obtain information.

It is not enough just to scratch the surface of a CD-ROM to ensure that interested parties will not be able to analyse the information successfully.\nEven old or defective IT systems often contain numerous pieces of information that may be of interest. For example, test purchases of used hard disks by a computer magazine found that 90 % of the hard disks purchased still contained all of the data of the previous owner.\n## Examples:\n* Two scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studied how much sensitive data could get into the hands of unauthorised persons by purchasing used computers and computer components. Their research found that only 10 % of the IT components were erased in such a manner so that no data could be reconstructed.

In particular, it may be difficult to provide the substitute with the required documents or data stored on the telecommuting computer if there is no way to access the home workplace of the telecommuter.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.54 Loss of confidentiality through hidden pieces of data", "description": "When data is communicated electronically or data media are transferred, it is not unusual for information that should not be passed on to leave the organisation. The following are some examples of possible reasons why information might be disclosed unintentionally:\n* A file contains text passages that are formatted to be \"hidden\" or \"invisible\". Such text passages can include comments not intended to be seen by a recipient.\n* Files created with standard software such as word processors or spreadsheet programs can contain a lot of additional information such as directory structures, version numbers, authors, comments, editing times, last print dates, document names and document descriptions. In particular, functions that allow several persons to work on a document simultaneously must be emphasised in this context. Such functions do not really delete the text passages overwritten or deleted from a document, but merely flags them as deleted so that later on another editor can undo some or all of the changes. Virtually all office software (Microsoft Office and OpenOffice, for example) offer this option. If the data contained in these changes is not removed before the document is passed on, the recipient could receive not just the actual document but a wealth of additional information as well.\nVirtually all the office packages available today provide \"fast save\" options for documents in which only the changes made to a document are saved. This has the result that only modifications made to a document are saved. This is quicker than a full save operation in which the office software saves the completely revised document. However, a full save requires less storage space on the hard disk than a fast save. The critical disadvantage, however, is the fact that a file saved using a fast save function can contain fragments of text that the author did not intend to pass on.\n* Another way that information not intended for outsiders can be passed on is functions, which, for example, allow a table from a spreadsheet document to be embedded in a text document or presentation in such a way that the spreadsheet table can be edited directly in the text document. If such a text document is passed on, a lot more information from the spreadsheet document than is actually visible in the text document could also be passed on under certain circumstances.\nWhen a file is copied to a diskette, the physical memory area (block) needed is filled entirely. If the original file does not require an entire memory block, then the unused part of the block (after the end-of-file indicator) is filled up with any residual IT system data found.\n* On z/OS systems, deleted members are not immediately overwritten in the library (PDS -Partitioned Dataset). Only the entry for the member in the PDS directory is deleted. The information relating to the old member is only overwritten once free space is required in the PDS. The data not yet overwritten can be read using a utility program.\n* When files on a hard disk are deleted in a z/OS system, the files are flagged as deleted in the Volume Table of Content (VTOC), but the files themselves are not deleted from the hard disk. The files are not overwritten until new data needs to be saved on the hard disk and there is no more free space available. Someone who succeeds in reading the storage location of the file from the VTOC would be able to edit and restore the file using special programs. The same applies to tapes that are marked as empty tapes, but have not yet been overwritten.\nResidual information on data media\nOn most file systems, files deleted by the user entering a delete command are not really deleted in the sense that the information no longer exists after the command has been executed. Normally, only the references to the file are deleted from the administration information of the file system (e.g.\nfrom the File Allocation Table in a FAT file system) and the blocks that belong to the file are marked as \"free\". The actual content of the blocks on the data medium is retained, however, and can be reconstructed with appropriate tools.\nIf data media are passed on to third parties, for example\n* when a computer is taken out of service and sold,\n* when a defective machine is sent in to be repaired or is replaced under the terms of the warranty, or\n* when a data medium is handed over to a business partner when exchanging data media, then sensitive information may be disclosed to the outside world.\n", "examples": "* Between 2000 and 2002, the researchers Simson Garfinkel and Abhi Shelat from MIT purchased a large number of second-hand hard disks from various dealers through the online auction house eBay and examined these to see what residual information they contained, if any.

They published their results in an IEEE journal.\n* While using a different editor, one user accidentally discovered several URLs, along with a user name and a password for a web server, in a file he was about to send. The address of a web document is called a URL (Uniform Request Locator). Access to the web page can be password-protected.\n* Presentation slides created with Microsoft PowerPoint were handed over as files to a third party by a government agency. It was discovered later that, in addition to the presentations, the files also contained information about the user's computer environment, such as the names of the newsgroups to which he was subscribed and which news items he had already read. Among other things, the PowerPoint file contained the following entries: de.alt.drogen! s21718 0 de.alt.dummschwatz! s125 0\n* Two sales representatives from competing companies exchanged presentations they held at a business event. One of the PowerPoint documents contained a small table with end customer prices for products from that company.

On an organisational level, it must be guaranteed that new components are registered with and approved by the system administrators, e.g. with the help of an automatic notification from the Purchasing\nDepartment or a corresponding application from the organisational unit operating the components.\nNon-registered components are a security risk, since they are not integrated into organisational in-house procedures and controls. On the one hand, this may result in risks for the users of the non-registered components (e.g. loss of data, since the system is not integrated into the data backup scheme), but also in threats for other network components, e.g. non-registered access points to the network may cause vulnerabilities if these are protected poorly or not at all against unauthorised access.

In the following, some examples for problems caused by a missing or poor strategy for network and system management can be found.\nMissing requirements analysis before defining the management strategy\nIn order to be able to define a network and/or system management strategy, a requirements analysis must be performed in advance. In the absence of determined management requirements (e.g: What are the manageable network switching elements? How dynamic is the software inventory to be managed?), requirements regarding the management strategy cannot be formulated. Since the management strategy additionally influences the software product to be procured, this may result in the wrong decisions being made.\nFor example, if a management product with too small a scope of functions is introduced, this gap in the functionality may cause an additional security problem, since the required function must be provided \"manually\". In larger systems, this may easily result in misconfigurations.\nProcurement of non-manageable components\nIf a computer cluster is administrated with the help of a network and/or system management system, it must be ensured when procuring new components that these can be integrated into the respective management system so that they can be incorporated in management. If this is not the case, this at least results in additional administrative effort, since the defined management strategy must also be enforced on the components not administered with the help of the management system. However, since these components are not integrated into the automated administrative procedures of the management system in particular, misconfigurations may occur. This entails a security risk related to uncoordinated configurations.\nUncoordinated managing of adjacent areas (communities, domains)\nIf a computer network administrated with the help of a management system has several administrative areas each of which is supported by a separate system manager, their competences must be defined unambiguously by the management strategy. If this is not the case, security problems may occur if individual components are managed in an uncoordinated manner.\nFor example, if individual components such as network switching elements are incorrectly administered by two administrative areas (this may occur if no different SNMP passwords\n(community strings) are used) on the one hand, the uncoordinated setting of configuration parameters may cause security gaps.\nIf, on the other hand, components (e.g. printers) are used jointly by two administrative areas and if the trust relationship of one of the administrative areas (e.g. Windows NT network sharing) was not configured properly, this may cause accidental security problems if unauthorised persons are also granted access.\nNon-integrated management software\nWhen administrating medium and large-scale systems, it may happen that new components are to be integrated into the system upon introduction of the management system, the administration of which requires functions not supported by the management system used. This applies specifically to the field of application management. If management software that cannot be integrated into the management system used (e.g. using a programming interface or using so-called gateways) is now used for administrating the new component, coordinated integration into the management system is not possible. Thus, the new component is not subject to \"automated\" management, making\n\"manual\" administration necessary. The specified management strategy must now be implemented for two systems, which may however result in misconfigurations which could cause security gaps.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.61 Unauthorised collection of person-related data", "description": "When using management systems, a large amount of logged data is incurred within the framework of the normal procedure, which is normally generated and analysed automatically. This particularly applies to the fields of network and system monitoring. Without extensively logging the system activities, security violations cannot be detected, for example. However, one requirement within the framework of monitoring is the unambiguous allocation of certain accesses to users. This way, the monitored user activities require person-related logging, however. Normally, the management strategy defines the user activities to be monitored for security reasons in a cross-organisational manner and in consultation with the Data Protection Officer. The affected users must be informed accordingly. However, compliance with the specifications defined by the management strategy must be checked within the framework of system auditing. Furthermore, it is possible that the management system creates temporary log files within the framework of a regular function that are stored in the low-protection area for temporary files, for example. In this case, the log files are potentially accessible for the time they exist and may additionally contain user information.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.62 Inappropriate handling of security incidents", "description": "In practice, it is impossible to completely eliminate the possibility of encountering security incidents. This is also true even when a number of security safeguards have been implemented. If appropriate action is not taken in response to an acute security incident, then the result could be large amounts of damage, and even a catastrophe under some circumstances.\nExamples include:\n* New computer viruses with damaging functions initially appear only sporadically, but eventually appear everywhere. If appropriate action is not taken promptly, then entire organisational units can cease to function under some circumstances.\n* Altered content is found inexplicably on a web server. -If such an incident is not investigated as a possible indication of an attack by hackers, then further attacks to the server can also lead to a considerable loss of image under some circumstances.\n* Suspicious entries are found in the log files of a firewall. If the entries are not examined for signs of a possible attempt to hack in to the system, then attackers could successfully attack and overcome the firewall without being noticed and penetrate the internal network of the organisation.\n* The presence of new security gaps in the IT systems used is announced. If this information is not obtained promptly and the necessary countermeasures are not implemented quickly, then there is a danger that attackers could exploit the corresponding security gaps.\n* There are signs of manipulation to corporate data. If such a discovery does not trigger an investigation into the cause of the manipulations, then undetected manipulations could result in severe consequential damage, for example incorrect inventory figures, incorrect accounts, or uncontrolled financial withdrawals.\n* If the cause of the compromising of confidential corporate data is not investigated, then additional confidential data may become disclosed.\nThese examples illustrate how important it is to detect security incidents early and report them quickly to the persons responsible. It is extremely important in such cases to react quickly and inform anyone who may be affected in order to prevent or minimise the resulting damage.\nBad and hasty decisions may be made under stress when there is no prescribed procedure available for handling security incidents.

For this reason, it is essential to use an organised approach for the planning, execution, and monitoring of the security process. Experience shows that it is not enough just to require security safeguards to be implemented because the individuals concerned, and especially the IT users, are often overwhelmed due to a lack of technical expertise and a lack of time. As a consequence, they often fail to implement the security safeguards at all, which means the level of security reached will be unsatisfactory. Even when an adequate security level has been achieved, it is still necessary to continuously adapt and improve the security process so that it can be maintained at all times during ongoing operations.\nAn inadequate security management is often a symptom of poor overall organisation of the security process. Examples of specific threats resulting from an inadequate security management include the following:\n* Lack of personal responsibility: If an organisation does not assemble a security management team or does not appoint an IT Security Officer and personal responsibility for the implementation of individual safeguards is not clearly defined, then it is likely that many employees will deny their responsibility for information security by pointing out that the next level in the organisational hierarchy is responsible. As a result, the security safeguards are not implemented because their implementation is almost always considered at first to be an additional load on top of their routine work.\n* Lack of support from management: The IT Security Officers are not usually members of top management. If the persons responsible for security do not receive unconditional support from management, then it may be difficult to effectively require the necessary safeguards to be implemented by the people directly above them in the organisational hierarchy. In this case, it is impossible to fully implement the security process.\n* Inadequate strategic and conceptional specifications: Many organisations will create a security concept, but in many cases only a few insiders will be familiar with its contents. As a result, the specifications are knowingly or unknowingly not followed in locations where organisational time and effort would be required. When the security concept contains strategic security objectives, these objectives are often simply considered to be a collection of declarations of intent, and adequate resources are not provided for their implementation as a result. In many cases, it is incorrectly assumed that security is produced automatically in an automated environment. Damage events in the organisation or in similarly structured organisations will occasionally trigger more or less fervent activity in which only some sub-aspects at the most are actually improved upon.\n* Inadequate or misdirected investments: The management of an organisation must be informed regularly of the security status of the business processes, IT systems, and applications as well as on existing shortcomings in security reports containing clearly defined priorities. Without adequate information, management will make decisions based on the wrong assumptions. It is likely in this case that management will not provide enough resources for the security process or that these resources are not used properly. The improper use of resources can result in a situation where one area will have an excessively high security level while other areas have serious security shortcomings. It is commonly observed that expensive technical security systems are used incorrectly and are therefore rendered ineffective or even pose a security risk.\n* Inadequate enforcement of security safeguards: To reach a consistent and adequate level of security, it is necessary for various areas of responsibility in an organisation to co-operate with each other. A lack of strategic guidance statements and unclear objectives can lead to different interpretations of the importance of information security, among other things.\nConsequently, it is possible that the areas of responsibility required to co-operate with each other will not assume the task of providing information security due to a supposed lack of necessity or poor prioritisation, and therefore that it is impossible to enforce the implementation of the security safeguards.\n* Failure to update the security process: New business processes, applications, and IT systems as well as new threats are constantly affecting the security status of an organisation. If there is no effective auditing concept available that also increases awareness of the new threats, then the security level will drop accordingly. As a result, the security level actually achieved will slowly drop and result in a dangerous illusion of security.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.67 Incorrect administration of site and data access rights", "description": "If the assignment of site and data access rights is controlled poorly, this may quickly result in serious security gaps, e.g. due to chaotically assigned rights.\nIn many organisations, the administration of site and data access rights is an extremely labour-intensive task, because it is controlled poorly or the wrong tools are used. For example, this may require comprehensive \"manual work\", which in turn is very susceptible to error. Furthermore, this process frequently involves a host of different roles and groups of persons so that the tasks performed are also easily lost track of.\nMoreover, there are organisations without any control regarding all users and their assigned rights configured on the different IT systems. This typically leads to finding accounts of users who have left the government agency and/or the company long since or who accumulated too many rights due to different activities.\nIf the tools for the administration of the site and data access rights were poorly chosen, they will often lack the flexibility to adapt to changes in the organisational structure or to migrations to other IT systems.\nThe roles of the users may have been separated improperly, which may then result in security gaps, for example by incorrectly assigning users to user groups or granting users rights that are too extensive. Users may have been assigned roles that do not correspond to their tasks (too many or too few rights) or which they should not have due to the tasks they perform (role conflicts).\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.68 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of Active Directory", "description": "The global structure of an Active Directory, i.e. how it is divided into domains, has a wide-ranging impact on the security of the resources administered in the Active Directory. In particular, problems can arise when different domains have different security requirements or the domains belong to different organisational units.\nThe following risks, for example, are posed to all domains due to a lack of or inadequate planning:\n* All domains in an Active Directory must use the same schema. Even when a software package requiring a change to the schema will be installed in only one domain, all other domains will also need to reflect this schema change. Incompatible schema changes made by different software products can result in software not being installed or not running correctly.\n* Certain user data from the Active Directory (Global Catalog) is available in every domain. This could result in violations of the data protection requirements when the type and level of detail of this information was not adequately coordinated in advance.\n* Administrators of the forest root domain also have extensive privileges in other domains. If the time specified until an administrator account is automatically locked is too long, then it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use administrator rights\n* If a domain is distributed between several locations that are not adequately networked with each other, then it may take a long time before an account lockout takes effect at all locations. As a result, a user whose account has been locked may still be able to log in to the system at another location under certain circumstances.\nThe structure of the Active Directory in a domain also needs to be planned carefully because otherwise it will be exposed to the following threats:\n* If computers and user accounts are placed below the domain in the predefined \"Computer\" and \"User\" containers, then it will not be possible to specify separate group policy configurations for the various types of user accounts or various types of computers. This could allow a user to circumvent the rights restrictions enforced by the group policies on an affected type of computer.\n* If organisational units (OUs) are deeply nested, then the structure of the domain could become so complex that it makes the Active Directory more susceptible to incorrect configuration. In addition, the performance of the Active Directory service decreases as the depth of nesting increases, especially when OUs are nested too deeply, e.g. when they span more than 4 levels.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.69 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of the use of Novell eDirectory", "description": "As a tool for resource management in networks, eDirectory is designed for use in a heterogeneous\nIT environment in numerous supported operating systems. The security of the overall system naturally depends on the security of every subsystem. The operating system security and specifically the file system security are the basis for the security of eDirectory.\nSince both eDirectory and the available client software can be installed and operated on numerous operating systems, this may result in a large variety of security settings to be performed in each case for the operating system used. This increases the planning requirements and requires the corresponding knowledge of all operating systems involved. Therefore, there is a risk that the use of eDirectory is not planned with sufficient levels of detail and thoroughness if the overall solution is very heterogeneous.\nPlanning the tree structure and mapping the company's infrastructure inside it are very important for using eDirectory in the intranet. In the event of erroneous planning, there is the risk of inconsistencies and excessive complexity in the directory service structure. This may result in misconfigurations or improper and/or poor operation of the system.\nThe global tree structure of the eDirectory directory has a large impact on the security of an eDirectory installation. In particular, problems may arise when different sub-trees have different security requirements or the sub-trees belong to different organisational units. Due to the implicit inheritance mechanisms and the complexity of the rules for determining the actually efficient, effective rights applying to an individual object, high requirements are placed on the planning of the system.\nThe implicitly used CA (certificate authority) is an essential part of the security of eDirectory.\nImproper planning may have significant adverse effects on the security of the directory service in this case as well.\nPlanning the access options for a directory service constitutes a core issue for system security. This applies both to the use on the intranet and particularly to the use of eDirectory as LDAP server on the internet.\nFurthermore, planning the administration of the directory service is an important issue. eDirectory allows implementation of a role-based administration concept, as well as the delegation of administrative tasks. This is particularly important with regard to security administration. Planning the administration requires the utmost diligence and care, since otherwise there is a risk of unauthorised system users unintentionally being provided with access.\nMoreover, the eDirectory software offers the iMonitor tool, which allows web-based monitoring access to the eDirectory servers and the directory system. An improperly planned use of this functionality might result in unauthorised users gaining access to internal information on the eDirectory installation.\nRegarding the operation of eDirectory, partitioning the directory service and its replication are important items. Here, poor planning may result in poor performance, inconsistencies regarding data storage, and losses of data in the worst case.\nThe eDirectory directory service allows for role-based administration of the directory database, as well as for delegating individual administrative tasks. In this regard, the administrative roles and the delegation options must be planned in accordance with the security policy to be specified (see S 2.238 Specification of security guidelines for Novell eDirectory). If the administrative tasks are not planned at all or planned erroneously, there is the risk of the system being administrated insecurely or poorly.\neDirectory allows for synchronising directory data with other directory services using DirXML.\nDirXML consists of a core (engine) and specialised drivers (e.g. for Windows 2000 Active\nDirectory, Lotus Notes, SAP R/3, Netscape, etc.) for exchanging directory information in the XML format. The third party directory services may use a so-called publisher channel to inform eDirectory of changes. If the rights are assigned accordingly (depending on the system under examination in each case), these changes will also be active in the eDirectory. The external directories may in turn register with the eDirectory in order to obtain information about changes to the set of eDirectory information using this channel (subscriber channel) and to synchronise their directory accordingly. This synchronisation requires detailed planning, because sensitive data could be copied automatically unintentionally to an external computer otherwise. It is also possible, for example, to unintentionally overwrite existing data in this manner. In order to protect the data during transport, SSL may be used. In this context, errors made during the planning phase may cause a loss of integrity and confidentiality regarding the directory data.\nIf nothing else, the use of login scripts for users and user groups must be planned. In the event of a lack of or improper planning, inconsistencies regarding the specified security policy may arise. Furthermore, the following problems may also result from a lack of or improper planning:\n* the administrative access to the system may be secured insufficiently,\n* the operation of the public key infrastructure may be inappropriate,\n* the system performance may be low, and\n* losses of data may occur, unless replication and backup have been taken into consideration to a sufficient extent.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.70 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of partitioning and replication in Novell eDirectory", "description": "Partitioning and replicating the eDirectory directory service are important aspects when planning the use.\nPartitioning is the process of distributing the directory data of the eDirectory among separate areas (partitions). Not every partitioning scheme can be implemented as desired, and the scheme must follow certain rules that are based on the logic of the hierarchical tree structure. On the one hand, the purpose of partitioning is to distribute the load of the directory system to several areas and, on the other hand, it can make a physical separation of the storage location of directory data - according to the locations of an organisation,or example - possible Moreover, partitions may also constitute administrative units of the directory system.\nFigure: Example for a partitioned eDirectory directory service\nThe replication of partitions of the eDirectory primarily serves to increase the availability and to distribute the load of the directory system. Redundant data storage also improves the reliability.\nFor this reason, planning is particularly important, because it may be possible to subsequently change the partition and replication settings, but such changes may lead to inconsistencies under certain circumstances.\nIn the event of changes to the eDirectory, it naturally takes a certain time until the new settings have spread to all areas. This may result in a window which the eDirectory is inconsistent. Such inconsistencies may be a problem, particularly when defining the authentication data or regarding the data access rights to eDirectory objects, for example.\nPartitioning the eDirectory directory has direct consequences for the inheritance of access rights\n(access control lists, ACL). In order to maintain the inheritance rules for an existing eDirectory tree, the root object of the new partition is informed about the superior ACL as inherited ACL by the system during partitioning.\nThe definition of the partitioning of the eDirectory service has direct effects on the replication activities of the overall system. In order to be able to efficiently search for objects in the entire tree (tree walking), the eDirectory automatically creates so-called subordinate reference replicas mainly containing branch addresses. If the planning is inappropriate (e.g. the tree structure is too flat), very comprehensive replication rings are generated here. If a replication ring becomes too large, there is a certain likelihood of at least one eDirectory server of the ring momentarily not being available. In such a case, error and status messages are generated on all other eDirectory servers of the replication ring. This may lead to an increase in the time and effort required for the administration of a large portion of the directory tree.\nFurthermore, incorrect or inadequate planning of the partitions and replication of the directory service may also lead to losses of data, as well as to inconsistencies in the data storage, to poor availability of the directory service, to lower overall system performance, and possibly even to system failures.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.71 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of LDAP access to Novell eDirectory", "description": "The LDAP access option to a directory service of eDirectory is an essential feature of the software product.

Simple web browsers or email clients may also act as LDAP clients, however.\nThe LDAP interface is also suitable to be used by network applications and their services for accessing the directory service. This access requires detailed planning, particularly in terms of the eDirectory rights needed to use the applications reasonably.\nTherefore, planning the LDAP access mainly depends on the operation scenario of the eDirectory.\nAs a matter of principle, there are three different types of connection for an LDAP client from the eDirectory's point of view:\n* As [public] object (anonymous bind): Here, no authentication information is requested and the [public] object is equipped with the unlimited browse right for the directory tree by default.\n* As proxy user ( proxy user anonymous bind ): This configuration option can be selected instead of the anonymous login. Here, the proxy user must be configured accordingly on the eDirectory.\n* As NDS user (NDS user bind ): Here, the user uses his/her eDirectory rights to log in to the directory service. The corresponding user object must be created in the eDirectory.\nDuring the planning phase, it must be taken into consideration whether and which data may be transmitted in plain text in accordance with the organisation's internal security policies. This is applicable for the use on the intranet and particularly for connection to the internet.\nFor example, this is a question as to whether user passwords may be transmitted in plain text and how consistently the use of SSL encryption is implemented. This way, eDirectory supports two types of connection in accordance with the LDAP v3 standard:\n* anonymous bind : without user name and password,\n* clear-text password bind: user name and plain text password for authentication.\nAdditionally, LDAP is protected with the help of SSL. On the eDirectory, it must be configured whether or not the first two types of connection are supported.\nFurthermore, SSL is supported on two modes: unilingual and bilingual authentication. For bilateral authentication, the required credentials must be generally accessible; amongst other things, the root certificate of the certificate authority.\nThe variety of the configuration options for LDAP access to the eDirectory directory service described above may quickly result in misconfigurations. Consequences of such misconfigurations may include:\n* errors in the assignment of access rights,\n* the ability to gain access to the eDirectory directory service without authorisation,\n* the transmission of user passwords in plain text,\n* spying on unencrypted information,\n* errors in LDAP accesses, especially for network-based applications, and * poor productivity of the overall system.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.72 Inadequate migration of archive systems", "description": "Archived data should typically remain stored over a very long period.

During the pilot phase of the archive system, documents from normal business operations were archived for testing purposes, with the test status being documented in the debug information. During the transition to the operating phase, the test documents were not deleted, since they had been archived to WORM data media, but the documents identified with the corresponding debug information were no longer displayed. The successor system was delivered by a different manufacturer representing debug information differently.\nDuring the subsequent migration of the archived data to the new archive system, the old debug field was accidentally not analysed, however. The old test documents were still in the archive upon completion of data migration, but suddenly emerged as allegedly authentic documents during later research.\n* Electronic signature methods may be compromised by trying the signature keys or by mathematical methods.

Selecting indexing keys inappropriately at this point would result in archived documents not or being searchable or only being searchable with great effort or the semantics of archived documents not being discernible unambiguously. On the other hand, a large number of context criteria increases the administrative effort and reduces the performance of the document management system in proportion to the increase of the number of archived documents.\nIndexing keys of the archive system, however, are of a rather technical nature. They serve for identifying individual raw data and organising the storage of the raw data to data media. Their selection normally does not depend on the DMS, but on the structure of the archive server and the underlying memory architecture. An essential requirement includes the unambiguousness of document identification. If this requirement is not complied with, i.e. if two documents are assigned the same document identification, the DMS may be provided with an incorrect document which is then assigned a new document context during retrieval depending on the search method. The document not found would be present from a physical point of view, but it would no longer be possible to unambiguously assign the document to a process in the DMS.\nThe auditing acceptability of the archiving process essentially refers to the unambiguous identification of all managed documents, as well as to the non-repudiation of the link between document and context information.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.75 Inadequate capacity of archival storage media", "description": "An inadequate assessment of the data volume during archiving may result in the use of archiving media that are too small, causing incomplete or delayed archiving.\nWhen assessing the required data volume, the expected maximum size of the documents to be stored is often the only influencing factor the assessment is based on.

This way, high data volumes may be generated even for small documents with high change frequencies. Old versions of the documents cannot be subsequently deleted from the archiving medium any more.

The conformity of text excerpts, e.g. using a text file, or the process of mapping further features, e.g. biometric data or context data, may also be required.\nStorage as text or image file alone is not always sufficient to verify that the document is faithful to the original, since both manipulations and errors may occur:\n* Text and image processing programs may be used to manipulate existing documents.\n* Errors while scanning may result in a falsified semantics of the stored data, which may cause erroneous interpretations and calculations.

For this, planning and organisational services must be provided from a security point of view, whereby these require careful planning from scratch.\nThe following security problems may occur when the migration is planned poorly:\n* The configurations could be imaged incorrectly or inconsistently, because this includes a new concept for the old infrastructure. Furthermore, an incorrect connection to the directory service may result in the policies and the Access Control Lists (ACL) becoming ineffective.\n* A loss of functionality may be triggered by poor protocol settings or other misconfigurations.\n* The administration of the system may be planned improperly and the administration limits may be defined ambiguously. Reviewing and adapting corresponding old concepts may be necessary. If the assignment of rights to administrators is planned improperly, this may cause gaps in the security and impairments of the system administration.\n* The required organisation-wide security policies could be implemented insufficiently due to poor planning of the migration of the security settings. This refers to both the access options to the server and the data stored on the server.\n* Data and information may be lost during migration, particularly if the system fails during the migration phase.\n* Necessary subsequent improvements of the productive systems' configuration may cause a loss of productivity.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.92 Poor control of browser access to Exchange", "description": "Exchange provides for the option of using a browser to access one's own email account.

If the required authentication methods are too weak, unauthorised persons may possibly access email data and system resources. If the used encryption mechanisms are too weak, data may be intercepted. In the event of insufficient authentication and encryption mechanisms, established connections may possibly be taken over by unauthorised third parties. Furthermore, the Exchange Server may be infected with viruses and other harmful code via this channel.\nFurthermore, the risk potential is manifold.

If the operation of routers and switches, which act as central elements in networks, is not incorporated in the company-wide security concept, the secure use of these components cannot be ensured.\nErrors made when planning the use of routers and switches usually fall into one of the following categories:\nInsufficient consideration of the intended use of devices\nWhen planning the use of routers and switches, the intended use of these components is crucial.\nOften the intended use of the components is not sufficiently taken into account at the planning stage, e.g. in the use of VLANs. Contrary to statements often made in advertising, VLANs were not developed to meet security requirements involved in the separation of networks. VLANs offer numerous points of attack so that additional safeguards must always be implemented, particularly in the field of separating networks requiring protection.\nErrors may also occur when the use of routing protocols is planned. If routers are used in demilitarised zones (DMZs), the use of dynamic routing protocols may jeopardise the availability, confidentiality and integrity of the network requiring protection.\nInsufficient consideration of security mechanisms\nThe existing security mechanisms (both in the existing network and for the network components to be used) are frequently not taken into account sufficiently during planning. For example, additional measures may be necessary if a device does not support certain security mechanisms. If this is not taken into account during the planning phase, problems may arise further down the line when the necessity is recognised.\nOne important point which is often not considered during planning, for example, is the setting up of a separate administration network (out-of-band management). If the selected or existing devices only support unsafe protocols such as SNMPv1, SNMPv2 or Telnet, it is imperative that an administration network is set up. In many cases this requirement is not addressed with the consequence that, in some circumstances, there are difficulties setting up the administration network later because the required connections are not available.\nNon-existent or inadequate information and documentation\nOccasionally, key information is not available during the planning phase, as no related documentation has been made available by the provider or the relevant documents are not taken into consideration.

A registration authority can issue names for one or more so-called \"top-level domains\" (for example DeNIC GmbH manages the top-level domain .de). Domains are not \"bought\"; they are only registered for a specific period. Once this period has expired, the registration must be extended by paying a fee. When domain names are registered and their registration is extended, errors are often made which may result in significant costs and a loss of prestige for the institution. Some of these errors are briefly explained below:\nDisregard of \"related\" domain names\nOften only the \"right\" domain name, i.e. the name which the organisation actually wants to use (for instance companyname.de), is registered. In doing so, the organisation overlooks the fact that Internet users who do not know the company's \"right\" domain name will simply try out \"related\" domain names (for example companyname.com or companyname.info)\n\"Related\" domain names are often registered by disreputable providers who might for example then run websites with competitive offers under the name. Although such services are often prohibited and shut down by court order, significant damage can be inflicted on the organisation's reputation during court proceedings which are often long and drawn out.\nFor example, in the year 2000 a German university had to take court action against a pornography provider who was using the .com domain name of the university. In 2004, a teenager managed to have the German domain for an on-line auction house transferred to him for a short time by exploiting a \"procedural error\" in the registration process. Furthermore, a fraudster may use a\n\"related\" domain name to create a fake website that is very similar to the original one. Such so-called phishing attacks should entice visitors to enter access data for the real website or credit card information for payment transactions. The fraudsters then use these data to obtain access to the real web server or to make purchases with the stolen credit card information.\nTrademark infringements\nThose registering domain names often fail to check whether the chosen name infringes registered trademarks belonging to other organisations, Such trademark infringements are usually noticed very swiftly. Trademark owners or lawyers / organisations specialising in cease-and-desist letters conduct regular searches for new domains which may infringe trademark rights and send out cease-and-desist letters which usually involve costs. Furthermore, the owner of a trademark can take the matter to court and demand the return or deletion of the domain. This can be costly and can also entail significant damage to an organisation's reputation.\nErrors made when extending domain names and changing registration authority\nDomain names must be regularly \"extended\" by paying an administration fee to the relevant registration authority. If the fee is not paid in time, the right to the domain name will be lost and other organisations can register the domain name. If the domain name in question is not company-specific, in the worst case it may be impossible to get back the lost domain. This\n\"orphaned\" domain could then be registered by a competitor or an organisation which then uses the domain to publish offensive or even illegal content.\nLess trustworthy registration authorities have been known to ring up customers of their competitors and claim that the registration has expired and must be renewed by making a further payment to them. When customers pay this fee, they also agree to a change of their registration authority.\nAn intended change of the registration authority, e.g. due to more favourable terms and conditions, may also result in problems. If mistakes are made during the change, the registration with the previous registration authority will be discontinued, but the new registration with the future registration authority will not performed or only performed with delays; during such period the domain can be registered by anybody in principle. Often, it can take a lot of time and expense to re-register the domain name, or re-registration is not possible at all.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.101 Inadequate contingency planning for a security gateway", "description": "Inadequate contingency planning may significantly worsen problems occurring during security gateway operation and may prolong downtimes.\nIn addition to the common mistakes frequently made in the context of contingency planning, there are certain special mistakes that can be made with a security gateway that make a fast reaction to security incidents very difficult or even impossible.

For complex systems such as multi-stage security gateways, additional problems may arise if dependencies between individual components are not known or documented or if they are not taken into consideration properly during planning.\n* If no replacement parts and/or devices are available for important hardware components and if no corresponding agreements (for example service level agreement or on-site replacement within a guaranteed period) have been concluded with the manufacturers or suppliers, this may cause significant downtimes and cost.\n* If there is no or only inadequate documentation of the configuration and the most important operating parameters, it may be very difficult to even restore a functioning configuration after an emergency.

For example, employees could become confused or lose motivation in this case.\n* Not enough financial or personnel resources are provided to conduct campaigns on information security.

In many cases, users will not use a recently installed security program because they do not know how to operate it and learning how to use it by themselves parallel to their daily work routine is often considered to be too time-consuming.

Since this person was considered indispensable and all available funds were used to purchase the system, he did not receive any training on the operation of the system platform or on the type of firewall used.\nRequests for external seminars were rejected due to a lack of funds, and the organisation did not even purchase any additional manuals. Two months after starting operation of the firewall system, it was discovered that internal systems were freely accessible from the Internet due to the incorrect configuration of the firewall.\n* A company was preparing to migrate to a new operating system. The employee responsible for this had expert knowledge of the platform used up until then, but was not familiar with new systems being discussed and was not provided with the corresponding training either. For this reason, he visited some free events held by a manufacturer, whose products he then favoured. This resulted in a poor and costly decision to introduce an unsuitable product.\n* In order to use the Internet during business trips, personnel firewalls were installed on the notebooks of the employees. The employees were not trained as to how to adjust the settings of the firewall to meet their needs. As a consequence, many employees then disabled the firewall so they could visit any Internet site they needed without any problems.

The relevant laws to be followed depend on the type of institution and/or its business processes and services. Depending on the locations of the institution, various national regulations may need to be followed. This is illustrated by the following examples:\n* In Germany, the handling of personal data is regulated by a large number of regulations. These include the Federal Data Protection Act and the State data protection laws, but also a large number of industry-specific regulations.\nIf personal data (e.g. confidential patient data) are transmitted over public networks without any protection during communication between two business units, this can lead to legal consequences under certain circumstances.\n* The management of a company is obliged to exercise due care for all business processes. This includes the consideration of recognised security safeguards. In Germany, various legal regulations such as KonTraG (Control and Transparency in Business Act), GmbHG (Law on Private Limited (Liability) Companies) or AktG (Public Companies Act) are in force, from which obligations to act and liabilities of the management and/or the board of directors of a company regarding risk management and information security can be derived.\n* The proper processing of booking-relevant data is regulated by various laws and regulations. In Germany, these include, among others, the Commercial Code (e.g. \u00a7\u00a7 238 ff.) and the General Tax Code (AO). The proper processing of information naturally comprises their secure processing. In many countries, both must be proven on a regular basis, for example, through external auditors within the scope of the audit of the financial statements. If this reveals major security deficiencies, a positive audit report cannot be issued.\n* In many industries (e.g. the automotive industry) it is common practice that manufacturers require their suppliers to comply with certain quality and safety standards. In this context, requirements regarding the information security are increasingly specified. If a contract partner fails to meet contractually regulated security requirements, this can result in contractual penalties, but also contract terminations or even the loss of business relationships.\nOnly few security requirements arise directly from laws. However, in general, the law is based on the general state of the art as a general basis for assessment of the degree of security that can be achieved. If, in an institution, the existing security safeguards bear no relation to the values to be protected and the state of the art, this may have serious consequences.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.106 Disturbance to business processes as a result of security incidents", "description": "Security incidents can be triggered by a singular event or a chain of unfortunate circumstances and can have a negative impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and IT systems.

At the London stock exchange, for example, the FTSE index dropped by 200 points after a broker accidentally entered one zero too many in an order.\nAt a hotel chain, a user forgot to enter one zero in an entry in the hotel's price database, which then resulted in the hotel chain offering luxury apartments in the South Pacific for one tenth of the actual price.\n* The network a large company was unavailable for more than 16 hours after the installation of a software update failed.

At the same time, though, achieving complete information security is practically impossible due to the variety of issues involved. For this reason, it is essential for the security management to set the right priorities and invest in those areas that bring the greatest benefits to the organisation. This is a decision that can only be made with the help of a security management process that applies to the entire organisation.\nWith the help of security management, the actual security requirements of the organisation are specified and the risks of not complying with these requirements are examined. The following must then be decided on the basis of these risks and requirements:\n* If resources will be invested in safeguards,\n* If the reorganisation or reassignment of the corresponding tasks reduces the time and expense required for protection to a reasonable level, and\n* If risks will be accepted\nThese are fundamental considerations for the approach to follow in terms of information security and must be recorded in corresponding documentation. Accordingly, a lack of or inadequate security management can lead to the following errors:\n* In many cases, an organisation will invest in expensive security solutions without providing the corresponding basic organisational regulations required. Authorities and responsibilities, when not clearly defined, can still lead to serious security incidents in spite of a high investment.\nPractical example: In one company, an expensive firewall was purchased, but the administrators only received inadequate training on the product, and the corresponding responsibilities were not clearly defined. Due to this, the firewall was not secure and was not properly configured to meet the security needs of the company. This resulted in security incidents because different administrators would repeatedly release services while certain functions remained unused for the most part.\n* In many cases, investments are made in information security in those areas of an organisation which have the corresponding resources available and in which the persons responsible for information security were especially aware of the issues involved. Other areas that were important to performing the specialised tasks and reaching the business goals were ignored due to a lack of resources or a lack of interest by the persons responsible.\nPractical example: To increase the availability of the accounting application, an expensive cluster system was purchased. However, due to a lack of financial resources for new systems, the applications needed by the Customer Service department were still run on an old server that could fail at any time. The availability of the customer service application is very important to the company, but this fact was not taken into account because no priorities were specified for the allocation of financial resources.\n* When investing in individual areas, it is necessary to consider the entire security concept.\nPractical example: A department was provided with a new security solution. However, power supply was poorly protected by an old UPS that had not been tested for a long time. The result is that there were still significant security gaps in the overall system.\n* The overall level of protection can drop when emphasis is only placed on increasing the level of protection provided to individual basic values.\nPractical example: Due to the use of a high-quality encryption routine when generating invoices, the speed of the workflows was significantly reduced. The selection process did not take into account that the availability of the systems is at least as important as their confidentiality.\n* The inconsistent and uncoordinated use of IT products can result in high financial and personnel expenditures.\nPractical example: In one large company, there are several different areas that independently examine information security. It turned out that two different areas had purchased a corporate license for a virus scanning program. In addition, it was discovered that different encryption products were used for the same purpose throughout the entire company. This lead to problems in administration and to an increased susceptibility to error.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.108 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of the use of SAP", "description": "A number of problems may arise when an SAP system is used without adequate planning. In such cases, security problems will always arise, in addition to other problems. The following presents only some of these problems, but should make it clear that proper planning is necessary before using an SAP system:\n* A medium-sized company wants to introduce an SAP system. The company decided to use a configuration in which the SAP system is installed on a single computer (single-host installation). Due to a lack of time, no resource planning was performed. In addition, the computer purchased was bought at a sale held by a computer manufacturer. After installation, it was determined that the computer was not equipped with enough main memory and could not be equipped with much more memory due to hardware restrictions. Delays and significant additional costs arose from the necessity to purchase new, more suitable hardware.\n* Since the separation of the roles was not planned while drawing up the administration concept, an administrator is capable of accessing all HR data on an R/3 system.\n* The responsibilities and procedures for change management and the business continuity concept for an SAP system were not specified during the planning phase. For this reason, developers have full access to the production system, since access \"is absolutely necessary to make emergency repairs\". It is therefore possible for the developers to access all account and credit card data belonging to the company's customers.\n* If a person has developer access capabilities to productive SAP systems (these rights are assigned using the S_DEVELOP authorisation object), this person may bypass the security mechanisms of the SAP system and access functions and data without authorisation.\n* The consequences of being able to call transactions in an SAP system without authorisation can be extensive. In general, it is possible to access functions and data not meant to be available to the person accessing them in such cases. If this also applies to administrative transactions, the security of the system can be completely undermined under some circumstances.\n* If an attacker is able to access the operating system level of an SAP system, the attacker may perform changes to the configuration of the SAP system. For example, it could be possible to access the profile parameters, which could then be changed to lower the access barriers (e.g. account lock settings), amongst other things. It would also be possible to access and change the configuration files of the Java stack. The level of security may be reduced drastically as a result. If the computer the database of the SAP system runs on is affected, the contents of the database could be obtained simply by copying the corresponding files. This would then undermine the security mechanisms of the SAP system.\n* The default settings in standard installations are generally not adequate to meet the security requirements of productive operations. If components are nevertheless operated in the production environment using their default configurations, there is a high risk of the security of the system and data being threatened. Possibilities for attacks are provided by the various unconfigured interfaces and range from unauthorised access to functions and data to the ability to execute operations on the operating system using the authorisations of the SAP system.\n* If the (publicly known) default passwords of important users such as \"SAP\\*\" or \"DDIC\" in the ABAP stack or \"administrator\" or \"system\" in the Java stack are not changed, attackers are able to obtain administrator access privileges. In this case, an attacker would have access to all data of the SAP system and would be able to execute administrative functions.\n* If an SAP system is taken out of operation and its identity (IP, SID) is not assumed by a replacement system, the incomplete decommissioning may result in an attacker adding his/her own SAP system to the network, which assumes the identity of the system taken out of operation. Access to the attacker's system by other SAP systems through existing destinations would then be accepted by the attacker's system. This means that data could be retrieved and stored on the attacker's system. This data also includes authentication information required for the login procedure. In many cases, technical users are set up simultaneously on several systems, which means that it would also be possible to gain access to other systems.\nIf the HTTP-based RFC SOAP interface is enabled on an SAP system (ABAP ICF service or JAVA Stack SOAP service), it is possible for users to call RFC-enabled modules via the HTTP interface. In general, this is not desirable in scenarios in which the SAP system is accessed using a browser. However, it is possible in this case to execute RFC calls, which means it could be possible to access data without authorisation, depending on the authorisation settings.\n* If important system events are not logged or the entries in the log are not evaluated, it is impossible to detect attacks or security violations. It is impossible to react to successful attacks or track down the source of an attack. For this reason, unobtrusive unauthorised accesses to data or functions is possible.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.109 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of the storage system", "description": "The selection and use of storage systems and storage networks requires careful planning, installation, and configuration in order to guarantee trouble-free operation.

High-availability storage environments in particular require highly detailed planning to avoid possible errors. Redundant components are often used to help increase the level of availability of storage systems. However, if the function of the storage system or storage network depends on the function of a single component at some location, the entire availability of the system is at risk. Such components are referred to as SPOFs (single points of failure).\n* The performance requirements for an application as well as the interoperability requirements regarding the existing software and hardware may make the use of specific products unavoidable. If these aspects are not taken into account at the appropriate time during the planning phase, the result may be expensive and inefficient corrections during the implementation phase, delays in usage, or even significant disruptions to operations.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.110 Inadequate organisation of release changes and migration of databases", "description": "All organisational steps to take before and while changing the version of the database management system (DBMS) or while migrating a database are recorded in migration and version concepts. The lack of such concepts can significantly impair the ability of the organisation to fulfil its duties if problems arise during a database migration or a DBMS upgrade and the DBMS or individual databases unexpectedly become unavailable.\nIf no secure rollback positions are set when planning the physical and semantic data migration, then the ability of users and applications to use the database or the DBMS may be threatened.\nWhen upgrading to a new version of a DBMS, the databases stored in the DBMS remain unchanged. Security problems are less likely to arise in this case in the database itself, but may arise due to the interaction of the databases with the new DBMS.\n", "examples": "* Due to a database upgrade, the basic type definitions were changed.\n* Access authorizations for the default user groups provided by the DBMS are changed and therefore affect the rights of the user groups based on the default groups.\nWhen migrating the data, the data is copied from one database to another database. When this is done, the data is converted in many ways and transferred to new database structures, possibly even to a completely different DBMS. In this case, it must be ensured that databases are able to use different constructions (triggers, constraints, etc.) to ensure the consistency of the data. The order of the data and the dependencies between the data are implemented using such constructions, and these constructions must be taken into account and correspondingly implemented on the other system when migrating data. The analysis and reimplementation of all constraints to be fulfilled can become very complex and extensive. This increases the risk of introducing errors that endanger the consistency of the data and the functionality of the system after the migration.\n## Examples:\n* When migrating a database from Microsoft Access to the Microsoft SQL Server, special attention must be given to all columns of type AutoNumber in Access since this type is implemented in different ways in different DBMSs.\n* In the database to be migrated, there are two tables named EMPLOYEES and COMPANY. To ensure that new employees can only be assigned to existing companies, the EMPLOYEES table is assigned an UPDATE/INSERT trigger that checks whenever new entries are added and/or changes are made to the EMPLOYEES table if there is an entry for the corresponding company in the COMPANY table.\nIf there is no corresponding entry in the COMPANY table, then the UPDATE or INSERT statement is cancelled. The order of implementation of the tables in this DB (colloquially: \"The company first, then the employees\") must be taken into account when migrating the database. If the EMPLOYEES table is transferred before the COMPANY table in the course of the migration, then the insertion will be rejected because there are no corresponding entries in the COMPANY table yet.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.111 Exposure of login data relating to change of service providers", "description": "When an organisation changes IT service providers, a variety of login data usually needs to be changed. This then leads to multiple communication of old and new login data. When this data is transferred insecurely, there is a risk of adverse affects on the confidentiality of the login data and, indirectly, on the integrity of the IT environment.\nThe login accounts used by a service provider are usually accounts possessing wide-ranging authorisations in the information system examined. Normally, only the user should know his or her password. Even old passwords are generally considered confidential information. In practice, though, the new service provider is often provided with a current, main password. Until the new service provider assigns new passwords to all consoles and applications, the old password could be misused by unauthorised third parties. Depending on the configuration of the system (e.g. on the service accounts, certificate services, etc.) and the organisation, it may be impossible to change the passwords quickly and without difficulty.\nIn many cases, the client itself is unable to administer the user accounts for the external service provider in a secure manner and may need to leave this task up to the new service provider.\nSituations such as the shared use of user accounts (account sharing) or the threats described in T\n3.16 Incorrect administration of site and data access rights and T 3.43 Inappropriate handling of passwords can be the result.\nIn some cases, the client itself either no longer has any information on which login accounts have administrative authorisation or may only be able to obtain this information through the regular notifications of new passwords sent by the service provider (account sharing). In each of these cases, the service provider makes the corresponding decisions and takes the corresponding action.\nThe client itself no longer has its own information on access data that it can use to implement strategic decisions. This situation corresponds to an environment with a high degree of outsourcing. It poses a high risk of threats to the system security when the rules and safeguards for outsourcing do not meet the security requirements and were not stated clearly in Service Level Agreements\n(SLA).\nOverall, situations in which critical administrative accounts are handled with even less care than normal user accounts are often encountered because the established standards of the company or the government agency for handling user accounts were disregarded and no procedures or guidelines were specified for handling administrative accounts when changing service providers.\n", "examples": "In small companies, the central server is often administered by someone from outside the organisation. This person then has the password for the main administrator account in this case.\nIn many cases, no other user in the company has access to an administrative account, not even the managing director. Instead, the managing director commonly stores the password for the main administration account in a safe. When a new service provider is contracted, the service provider is provided with this password. Sometimes there is not even a maintenance contract or any other type of long-term agreements on the type of outsourcing or procedures with any of the corresponding external personnel. Under certain circumstances, the old service provider may change the password and then terminate the service unexpectedly and without warning. In this case, it is impossible to administer the system again until the new password is obtained by requesting it from the old service provider or determining it using technical means.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.112 Inadequate planning of VoIP", "description": "In most cases, bad decisions made during the planning phase can only be corrected later at great expense. To enable reliable usage of VoIP, many aspects need to be taken into account.\nVoIP requires a functioning data network. This data network can also be used for other services such as e-mail and the Internet. Due to the additional IP packets necessary for VoIP, the data network can quickly become overloaded. The capacity of the network therefore plays a decisive role for problem-free operation. The consequences of misjudging the importance of this aspect can reach as far as the failure of all technical communication capabilities. Signalling and media transport protocols are needed to communicate using VoIP. In terms of signalling protocols, in which primarily control instructions are transmitted, so far no protocol has been successful enough to become the standard protocol. In addition to numerous proprietary solutions, the SIP and H.323 signalling protocols must also be mentioned. Many VoIP devices only support one protocol, a fact that has a decisive influence on the planning phase.\nThe selection of a media transport protocol is less critical, since only the Realtime Transport\nProtocol (RTP) has prevailed. When both communication partners support encrypted SRTP, their communication can be protected.\nFor the actual transmission of the voice information, a codec is needed that permits voice information to be converted into digital information. Although numerous codecs exist, the selection of a codec during the planning phase only plays a subordinate role. In general, the end devices support a number of codecs. When establishing a connection, the codec to be used is negotiated by the communication partners. If there are only a few codecs supported by both of the communication partners, then a codec may be negotiated which is not appropriate for use under the prevailing general conditions. This can lead to a high load on the network on the one hand, and to poor quality voice transmissions on the other hand.\nIn addition to the basic technical functionality, the possibility of using encryption between the devices also plays an important role when planning and purchasing VoIP devices. In some applications for example, a VPN encrypted with IPSec or SSL can be used. The installation of a\nVPN client is usually impossible, though, for dedicated VoIP hardphones. This means that if encryption of the media transport protocol, for example using SRTP, is not supported, an attacker may be able under some circumstances to listen in on these telephone calls.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.113 Inadequate planning of network capacity for the use of VoIP", "description": "A data network is needed to use the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Existing data networks, to which the workstation computers and servers are connected, or independent data networks can be used for VoIP. The main reason, though, for migrating from circuit-switching telephone solutions to VoIP is the lower cost of maintaining a single communication infrastructure when an existing data network is used.\nNot much experience with VoIP is available to date, since this technology is relatively new. If you want to replace a circuit-switching PBX system with VoIP, you generally cannot use the PBX experience gained in the past. This applies in particular to the response of the VoIP PBX system when the group of users is large.\nThe providers of VoIP PBX systems try to provide statements regarding the number of users their product can handle. However, these statements are not very accurate when an existing data network is used. When the workstation computers require large amounts of data, the network can quickly become overloaded when it is simultaneously used for VoIP. On circuit-switching PBX systems, the maximum number of ports to which telephones can be connected determines the maximum number of users.\nDepending on the configuration of the active network components, certain IP packets can be assigned a higher transmission priority when an overload occurs. If VoIP packets are transmitted according to their priority when the load on the network is high, it might no longer be possible to work efficiently on the workstation computers under certain circumstances. When all IP packets are sent with the same priority, the problem-free use of VoIP cannot be guaranteed any more.\nEven if the existing network had enough capacity to use VoIP and transmit regular information in parallel when migrating to VoIP, this capacity might not be sufficient for future constellations. If new employees are hired, then they will need to work on their workstation computers over the data network and be able to make telephone calls using VoIP. This means the load placed on the network will increase and quickly use up the free resources.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.114 Inconsistent security settings for SMB, RPC, and LDAP under Windows Server", "description": "For Windows servers, the inherently insecure communication protocols SMB/CIFS and LDAP were equipped with extended signature and encryption mechanisms. In Windows Server 2003 and higher, some of the mechanisms are already configured with default settings in the local security policy.\nThe use of these mechanisms affects both the communication with all other Windows servers in the network as well as many basic services provided by Windows, and their use therefore affects the entire network. If these settings are not specified consistently and correctly throughout the network, then problems ranging from side effects that are difficult to track down to the malfunctioning of individual Windows servers and clients may be the result.\nThe availability of large sections of the Windows network can be severely affected by faulty configurations, executing procedures incorrectly, and activating the signature and encryption settings for SMB/CIFS and LDAP in the wrong order. In large environments, it may be very difficult to restore the Windows network to an operable state since many network-based administration and control functions are disrupted in such situations.\nInconsistent settings in a domain, especially on domain controllers, pose a great threat because the symptoms (malfunctions in administration functions such as group policies) may only be noticed after a while under some circumstances.\nOlder Windows versions are not directly compatible with the stricter security settings for\nSMB/CIFS, RPC, and LDAP. For example, trust relationship settings without Kerberos authentication, which are commonly used in large information systems distributed across several sites, are not directly compatible with the stricter security settings. Through inadequate analysis of all affected IT systems and insufficient planning of the application, unexpected problems in communication can seriously restrict the overall availability in all areas. Insufficient planning can lead to high implementation costs later on.\n", "examples": "In large environments, problems can arise when adding a server to a domain as well as with trust relationships if no continuous trust relationship on a Kerberos basis is used. Although the correct password has been entered, login attempts sporadically fail depending on the domain controller that is randomly selected for authentication attempts. Even the functionality of applications can be adversely affected.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.115 Inappropriate handling of standard security groups in Windows server 2003 and higher", "description": "In the Windows Server operating system as of version 2003, additional standard groups were added to the security groups already built in to Windows 2000 Server. The rights for these groups cannot be restricted in some cases, and full documentation is not provided by the manufacturer for all authorisations. Certain authorisations are not displayed and cannot be administered, such as those for the Network Configuration Operator group.\nThe groups themselves do not pose a general threat, but a lack of knowledge of how these groups work and what is considered inappropriate use can lead to the deliberate or accidental abuse of administrator privileges and to faulty configuration of the system. However, lack of knowledge regarding the method of operation of such groups as well as their inappropriate use may result in intentional or accidental misuse of administrator rights and in misconfiguration of the system.\nNew groups with Windows Server 2003 and higher are:\n* Help Services Group\nThis group for the help and support centre is not needed for the administration and operation of the server but is capable of being misused or incorrectly configured because the group can be granted wide-ranging authorisations for administration tools.\n* Network Configuration Operators\nMembers of this group can set and change the parameters of the TCP/IP stack and can therefore make the server inaccessible or open to attack.\n* Performance Monitor Users and Performance Log Users\nPerformance monitor users are allowed to execute and operate the System Monitor program (perfmon.exe) without requiring special authorisation. Members of the Performance Log Users group can view and administer the system monitor logs and can configure it to record monitoring data. They have direct access to part of the Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI) database. The information in performance and usage logs is critical to security, just like information on failures and malfunctions that could indicate possible attempts to attack.\nA threat is posed when user accounts unintentionally obtain additional authorisations through these groups.\n* Remote Desktop Users\nMembers of this group can also log in to a member server or stand-alone server from another computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and then work on the server as if they were sitting directly in front of the physical system. This poses a risk since every normal user can log in to the server in this manner without requiring any additional, special authorisation.\n* Distributed COM Users\nIn Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 or higher, there are detailed authorisation structures available for distributed COM objects (DCOM) to enable better control of the execution of COM modules and the activation of COM objects. In particular, execution from other clients using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) is easier to control using these structures. Many Windows functions can be controlled using COM objects, including Windows Update, guideline result sets, and certificate services. The authorisations are configured in the console \"Component service\". By default, the distributed COM users have the highest authorisation limit, which even extends beyond the rights granted to normal administrators. Improper handling of this group can make the improved DCOM security functions ineffective or even increase the risk of attack on the system.\n* Creating incoming forest trust relationships\nSince Windows 2003, this group is new on domain controllers. Members of this group can create unidirectional, incoming trust relationships to the Active Directory forest of an IT system. Using trust relationships, rights can be exercised in the other domain environment. So, misuse or negligent handling of this group may provide multiple possibilities to attackers to influence the whole information system.\nWith Windows Server 2008, further groups are present after installation. This applies both to standalone systems and to servers within a domain.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.116 Data loss relating to copying or moving data in Windows server 2003 or higher", "description": "The moving and copying of objects or entire subtrees to or from directories consists of several, sometimes hidden, procedures that can make the data objects and directory structures moved unusable. The threat does not originate for the most part from individual users, but rather from administrators since they sometimes need to move large or system-critical databases.\nA classic threat often encountered in migration scenarios is posed by moving objects of the file system past media or system limits. This data is not checked at the destination before it is removed from its original location. The data affected by the move may become lost.\nLess obvious is the behaviour of object meta-information such as access authorisations or other attributes, which applies to several objects at the same time. Complex authorisation structures with automatic inheritance mechanisms that have different effects on the source and destination locations are often active in the directory structure. For example, with Microsoft Windows a move of a file copies the existing file authorisations to the destination, but a copy resets the file authorisations at the destination according to the specifications there. A prerequisite is, of course, that the destination is able to interpret the authorisations and other meta-information correctly. Otherwise, authorisation structures developed over a long period can be lost all at once.\nDifferences between individual components can arise in terms of the effects of copying and moving mechanisms, in Windows Server 2003 for example between the file system, the component services, the Internet Information Services (IIS), and the Active Directory. A lack of knowledge of the underlying operating concepts of these mechanisms and a lack of thoroughness can quickly lead to a loss of data and incorrect system configurations.\nUnexpected effects when copying and moving data may also be due to the underlying system components used to save and generate objects and directories. Examples for Windows Server 2003 include the Distributed File System (DFS), Active Directory, and the Encrypting File System (EFS). The read and write process for a copy/move in the EFS contains steps for temporary storage and cryptography, accessing certificate services, and storing public keys as meta-information. The copying and moving of files and directory trees by inexperienced personnel can quickly lead to the unavailability or incompleteness of the data or make it impossible to guarantee the confidentiality of the data.\nIn the NTFS file system in particular, unexpected effects in files can arise due to Alternate Data\nStreams (ADS). Alternate Data Streams are invisible sections of a file in which Windows Server\n2003 can store additional information such as time zone information or pictographs.\nThe command line and the Windows Explorer respond differently when handling Alternate Data\nStreams. Through move and copy operations, an ADS can be changed accidentally or intentionally, become lost, or be filled with content without your knowledge. If adequate protection is not provided using suitable file authorisations, an ADS can become a very dangerous point of attack.\n", "examples": "On a domain controller, the Windows command xcopy is used to copy the contents of the system drive to another hard disk partition. The command is called with certain parameters that are also used to copy the SysVol folder. After the copy operation, the data on the system drive are not needed any more and are deleted recursively (e.g. using rd /s). However, after the copy, not all information normally replicated through the SysVol folder (e.g. group policy objects, login scripts) is available any more on this domain controller. This is due to the structure of the SysVol folder, which contains connection points (referred to as junction points) to shared DFS's replicated using the File\nReplication Service (FRS). In this case, xcopy does not back up all contents of the folder, and only copies the junction points. The recursive delete operation performed later reaches the original shared DFS through the copied junction points and deletes some of its contents, provided that the authorisations available permit this. In certain circumstances, the deletion is then replicated on other domain controllers, with the result that operations throughout the domain are disrupted. The problem can only be eliminated by restoring the system status everywhere from data backups.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.117 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of the use of WLAN", "description": "A WLAN must be carefully planned and installed so that any existing security gaps cannot adversely affect any IT system connected to the WLAN. When care is not taken, the result could even be the compromising of the government agency or company network connected to the inadequately secured WLAN. Security gaps can also result when the security mechanisms between the LAN and WLAN are not configured properly, for example due to inadequate planning when dividing the users into user groups.\nA number of problems can arise from a lack of, or inadequate, planning of WLAN usage, for example the following:\n* It may be possible for third parties to read sensitive data if no or only inadequate security safeguards are implemented in the WLAN.\n* The performance of a wireless network could be reduced by other overlooked WLAN installations or wireless systems if the signals they emit extend into the usable range of the wireless network.\n* If, when planning a WLAN, the blocking of the signals by the building itself or by absorbent construction materials (for example, steel cabinets, plumbing units, supply lines, steel-reinforced concrete constructions) are not taken into account, then this may also reduce the performance of the WLAN.\n* Common-channel interference from a neighbouring wireless cell of the WLAN can also often cause interference in the WLAN. As a result of this, the signals from two users of neighbouring cells may interfere with each other, since their radio waves will become superimposed in the room and cause interference.\n* The performance of a WLAN can be severely affected by dead zones. When inadequately planned, the transmission power of the WLAN transmitter is usually simply increased to prevent dead zones. This may mean that the WLAN emits signals into areas in which it is not needed and in which they can be intercepted under certain circumstances.\n* One effect of poor planning may be, for example, inadequate transmission capacity, which may then limit or even prevent the use of high-bandwidth applications.\nAn additional threat is posed to the LAN when there is only one inadequately protected connection between the access points or distribution system and the cable-bound infrastructure. If there is no physical or logical protection at the level of the distribution system, then the entire broadcast domain in which an access point is located can be listened in on after compromising the protection of the wireless interface or security settings of the access point. The information obtained could then be used for an attack on the entire LAN.\n", "examples": "If the filter rules are specified too loosely for the security gateway on the transfer point located between the distribution system and the LAN, then an attacker could tunnel into this transfer point using a man-in-the-middle attack by cleverly manipulating the communication data and therefore gain access to the internal LAN infrastructure. A prerequisite for this type of attack is that either the security mechanisms on the wireless interface are compromised or direct access to the distribution system is available. In addition, vulnerabilities at the operating system level can also be used for tunnelling purposes if the systems of the transfer point have not been adequately hardened.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.118 Inadequate regulations for the use of WLAN", "description": "In general, no security mechanisms are enabled in the default settings of access points. When\nWLAN components which are insecure due to a lack of specifications are put into operation in a production environment, they pose a serious threat to the WLAN and the IT systems connected to them. This type of threat is comparable to the threat posed by an insecure Internet connection.\nWhen an employee connects an unauthorised or insecure access point to an internal network of an organisation due to a lack of rules regulating WLAN usage, the employee practically undermines all security measures implemented in the LAN used to protect against unauthorised external access from the Internet, for example the firewall.\nUnclear responsibilities\nIf the responsibilities are not clearly stated, the result may be faulty configuration of WLAN components due to a lack of rules regulating the administration of the WLAN infrastructure, for example. When there are no specifications for configuration management, then it only takes one access point or one WLAN client not configured according to the specified default profile to compromise the entire network of the organisation.\nWhen the various responsibilities are not coordinated adequately in an organisation or with external service providers, problems will always result in actual practice. In terms of the WLAN, threats are posed in particular when different groups are responsible for supporting the physical (passive) infrastructure, the active network technology, and the security systems; these groups are located far away from each other organisationally; and these groups are only coordinated by a correspondingly higher management level.\nProblems can also arise when there are no uniform rules defined for documenting system changes, for example when exchanging WLAN components, changing configurations, or replacing the\nWLAN key information.\nNo rules regulating monitoring\nIf there are no specifications available for the monitoring of the WLAN infrastructure and the corresponding financial and personnel resources are not provided, then attacks on the WLAN may not be detected in time. This includes checking the following, for example:\n* Without regular checks, the connection of external access points (including private access points) to the distribution system or directly to the LAN may go unnoticed.\n* If the WLAN logs are not analysed regularly, security incidents will not be detected in time. For example, a sudden increase in the number of unsuccessful login attempts on the access point may indicate an attempt to attack the WLAN.\nIf urgently needed updates of the virus protection software or security-related patches are not installed in time, then WLAN components may become compromised. WLAN components with direct access to the Internet or which are used in public WLANs are especially at risk. Depending on the type of malware, the next connection to the home WLAN could lead to the compromising of the entire WLAN infrastructure and beyond.\nA lack of rules regulating reactions to security incidents in the WLAN\nIf no consideration is given to how to react in an emergency to security incidents when operating a WLAN, then it may take a long time until security problems are detected and eliminated. In the meantime, though, there may be data leaks or attacks by worms. Even when an attack is noticed, the appropriate countermeasures may not be implemented in time (within minutes) when there are no safeguard catalogues (which must be prepared accordingly), controlled procedures, or authorisations necessary for intervention available.\n", "examples": "* One company published the information for accessing an internal WLAN in the Internet to simplify access for mobile employees when on the road. Anybody with this information is therefore able to provide authentication when logging in to the WLAN and could possibly gain access to data requiring protection. Although the WLAN itself only contained information with low protection requirements, access to the production systems could be obtained by connecting to a LAN. The data available here, for example secret design drawings of a prototype, were made public in part in the Internet. Other data was passed on to a competitor. The competitor therefore would have been able to determine what new developments were in planning and react quickly to this with its own corresponding development. Luckily, the competitor informed the police of the matter.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.119 Inappropriate selection of WLAN authentication methods", "description": "The selection of the authentication methods to be used must be based on the protection requirements of the data to be transported in the WLAN. Note that WEP must be considered insecure and offers a number of possibilities for attack, for example the ability to extract the keys from the data packets. These could then be used to successfully gain access to the WLAN.\nIf the key material used for authentication or encryption in the WLAN is not distributed with care or stored securely enough, then any method based on these keys which is used to attain a certain security level may be completely worthless. Passwords which are too simple and inadequately protected certificates can provide any attacker with valid access to a WLAN. In a WLAN secured using WPA, the pre-shared keys represent a security gap if they are selected inappropriately, i.e. when they are not complicated enough.\nThere are also EAP methods, though, that pose a threat due to a number of vulnerabilities. For example, CHAP which requires both sides to know the unencrypted password, among other things, is used as the authentication method in EAP-MD5. Furthermore, EAP-MD5 does not support the generation of keys and therefore cannot be used directly in conjunction with IEEE 802.11i.\nMoreover, cryptographic weaknesses have been discovered recently in the MD5 hash method, and so this hash method can no longer be considered secure.\nThe problem with EAP-PEAP from a cryptographic point of view is that PEAP only checks the identity of the server but not of the client to secure the outside tunnel.\nSome implementations of the EAP method also contain vulnerabilities. For example, the proprietary EAP-LEAP from Cisco is susceptible to dictionary attacks, and there are already tools available that utilise precisely this vulnerability and make even strong passwords ineffective.\nLikewise, another disadvantage of EAP-LEAP is that it must be supported explicitly by all WLAN components and that there is no interoperability between EAP-LEAP and other EAP methods available, contrary to the requirements in IEEE 802.1X.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.120 Inappropriate siting of security-related IT systems", "description": "If security-related IT systems on which authentication data is stored are installed in easily accessible locations, the result can be a severe threat to the overall security of a network.

Unsuitable locations for their installation include, for example, public meeting rooms, hallways, and normal offices.\nEven small network switching elements which, in spite of their size, are relevant to security such as routers, switches, and access points must not be placed in insecure, open spaces. Access points, for example, should not be installed unprotected directly under the ceiling.

Additional information, such as important certificates for authentication on the WLAN, was also stolen together with the access point.

If the WLAN is not monitored adequately, then most attacks will not be detected at all or only detected when it is too late.\nIncorrectly configured intrusion detection systems\nIf the communication patterns in the WLAN are not taken into account when planning an intrusion detection system, then this leads either to the inability of the intrusion detection system to detect attacks or to the triggering of an alarm by authorised communication.\nAn acute threat can also arise when logging IDS-relevant events:\n* If too much information is logged or the information is stored for too long, then there is a danger that the databases of the intrusion detection system will overflow.\n* If not enough or the wrong data is recorded when logging, then an attack may not be detected, and no reasonable post-mortem analysis can be performed.\nUnauthorised use of the WLAN\nIf authentication mechanisms are implemented to access a WLAN which are not strong enough, then an attacker could access the Internet, for example, via a WLAN installation. This would reduce the available bandwidth and lengthen the response times for authorised WLAN users.

If they use dictionary or brute-force methods in an attack, then error messages will be produced by the authentication components, which they then record in their log files. If these log files are not evaluated regularly, then such attacks cannot be detected and corresponding countermeasures cannot be taken.

If the overall solution needs to be highly heterogeneous, then there is a risk that the use of the directory services will not be planned with the proper detail or to the proper depth.\nThe planning of the tree structure as well as the representation of the organisational structure are very important, especially when using a directory service in the intranet. If the organisational structure is represented down to the last detail, then there could be problems with administration as a result. When planned incorrectly, there is a risk of inconsistencies and an overly complicated design of the directory service, which in turn could lead to faulty configurations as well as incorrect or inefficient operation of the system.\nThe global tree structure of a directory service has a large impact on the security of an installation.\nFor example, problems can arise when different subtrees have different security requirements or belong to different organisational units. Due to the implicit inheritance mechanisms as well as the complexity of the rules for determining the actual rights applying to an individual object, high requirements are placed on the planning of the system.\nIf a certificate authority (CA) is used, then this component is an essential component of security of the directory service. Incorrect planning can significantly impair the security of the directory service in this case as well.\nSince a directory service allows role-based administration of the directory database as well as the delegation of individual administration tasks, there is a risk that the system will be insecure or administered inefficiently if the administration tasks are planned incorrectly.\nFurthermore, the use of an administration tool may have been planned incorrectly and therefore allows unauthorized users access to internal information relating to the directory service installation.\nAdditional risks can arise when directory data is synchronised with other directory services, for example using DirXML with eDirectory from Novell. When the rights are assigned accordingly\n(which depends on the target system under examination), the changes will also be active in the directory service due to synchronisation.\nConversely, external directories can subscribe to their own directory service to receive changes to the information database and then synchronise their directory based on this. This type of synchronisation requires detailed planning because otherwise sensitive data could be copied automatically, but unintentionally, to an external computer under certain circumstances. It is also possible, for example, to unintentionally overwrite existing data in this manner. Planning errors in this case could result in a loss of integrity and confidentiality of the directory data.\nWhen using login scripts for users or user groups, a lack of planning or inefficient planning could lead to inconsistencies in the security policy specified. Furthermore, the following additional problems could also result from a lack of planning or inadequate planning:\n* If replication and backups are not properly taken into account, then the result could be losses of data.\n* The operation the public key infrastructure (PKI) could be inadequate.\n* The system performance could be too low.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.124 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of partitioning and replication in the directory service", "description": "Two essential aspects when planning the use of a directory service are the partitioning and replication processes. Partitioning is the process of distributing the directory data of a directory service among separate areas (partitions). Not every partitioning scheme can be implemented as desired, and the scheme must follow certain rules that are based on the logic of the hierarchical tree structure.\nThe replication of the partitions of the directory service serves primarily to increase the availability of the directory system and for the purpose of load distribution. Redundant data storage also improves the reliability. For this reason, planning is critically important because it may be possible to subsequently change the partition and replication settings, but such changes can lead to inconsistencies under certain circumstances.\nWhen changes are made to the directory service, it takes a certain amount of time until the new settings are installed everywhere because the directory service is distributed among several different systems. This can result in a time frame in which the directory service is inconsistent. Such inconsistencies can be a problem, especially in the definitions of authentication data or with the data access rights to directory service objects, for example.\nThe partitions defined for the directory service can have a direct impact on the replication activities of the overall system. If planned inadequately, then a flat tree structure, for example, could create very large replication rings. For example, if a replication ring is very large, then there will be a certain risk that at least one server in the ring will not be accessible for some time, which can then lead to the generation of error and status messages on every other directory service server in the replication ring. Such error and status messages can lead to an increase in the time and effort required for the administration of a large portion of the directory tree.\nFurthermore, incorrect or inadequate planning of the partitions and replication of the directory service can also lead to losses of data as well as to inconsistencies in the data stored, to poor availability of the directory service, to a lower overall system performance, and possibly even to system failures.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.125 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of access to the directory service", "description": "If the assignment of system and data access rights for or to the directory service are inadequate or are controlled using inappropriate tools, then this could quickly lead to serious security gaps, for example due to chaotically assigned rights. The administration of system and data access rights is an extremely labour-intensive task in which, in extreme cases, numerous work steps may need to be performed manually, and this can then lead to errors and a lack of an overview of the work performed.\nIn organisations in which there is no overview of all users set up on the various IT systems together with their rights profile, this lack of an overview usually leads to the existence of user accounts for users who have left the organisation a long time ago or to users accumulating too many rights due to their constantly changing tasks.\nIf the tools for the administration of the site and data access rights were poorly chosen, they will often lack the flexibility to adapt to changes in the organisational structure or to migrations to other IT systems.\nThe roles of the users may have been separated improperly, which may then result in security gaps, for example by incorrectly assigning users to user groups or granting users rights that are too extensive. Users may have been assigned roles that do not correspond to their tasks (too many or too few rights) or to which they should not have been assigned due to the tasks they perform (role conflicts).\nThe users often access the directory service over an LDAP interface, which is a widely used Internet standard. This access requires detailed planning, especially in terms of the directory service rights needed to use the applications sensibly. The planning of the LDAP access therefore depends primarily on the operational scenario of the directory service.\nInadequate planning regarding whether or not data, and if so which data (for example user passwords) is allowed to be transmitted in plain text can lead to inconsistencies or contradictions with the internal security policies of the organisation. Incorrect planning of the safeguards and security technologies of the directory service to protect confidential data can lead to incompatibilities or even to the failure of the encryption component.\nThe lack of a root certificate in the directory service or an unverifiable chain of certificates prevents mutual authentication for the use of the directory service.\nDue to the variety of configuration options for the LDAP access to the directory service, it is easy to specify a faulty configuration, which could then result in the threats listed in the following:\n* the ability to gain access to the directory service without authorisation,\n* errors in the assignment of access rights,\n* spying on information sent as plain text,\n* transmission of unencrypted user passwords,\n* inadequate availability of the overall system, and * errors in LDAP accesses, especially for network-based applications.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.126 Inadequate logging of changes to an Active Directory", "description": "The Active Directory in an organisation is usually a central part of authentication and authorisation of the access to network resources.

If inadequate or unlimited rights are granted, then the \"backup operators\" could obtain administrative authorisations for the domain under certain circumstances and therefore may be able to circumvent the role concept.\nIn organisations with several locations in particular, not planning the data backup could cause some branch offices to be forgotten or solutions for remote backup to be selected that do not offer the data to be backed up adequate protection, which could then enable someone to read security-related\nActive Directory data during transmission.\nIf the data backup interval selected is too long, then it is possible under certain circumstances for\nActive Directory objects to be installed that have been marked for deletion and whose service life has already expired while recovering a domain controller.

Extranet\nVPNs, for example, fall into this category. In this case, the organisation's own network is connected to the networks of other companies, taking into account functional restrictions and security requirements. For companies and government agencies, extensive damage may occur when security gaps in an external network have an impact on the organisation's own network via the VPN.\nExtranet VPNs are often used in the automobile industry and/or in industries requiring intensive cooperation between manufacturers and suppliers.\nThe following security problems, amongst other things, may arise due to a lack of or inadequate rules for the use of VPNs:\n* A VPN should not be allowed to \"grow organically\". The implementation of VPN accesses needs to be planned accordingly instead. Experience has shown that complex hardware and software scenarios may arise that are difficult to administrate, especially when continually expanding VPN access. This may lead to the selection of incorrect security settings that are mutually incompatible or cancel each other out.\n* Without a comprehensive and binding security concept, it is generally up to each of the administrators and VPN users to specify the security settings, which they will then do as they see fit. This may lead to unsuitable security settings that can prevent connections from being established or permit the establishment of insecure connections, for example. This may have an impact on the security of the LAN, because in many cases the IT systems connected to a VPN have the same access capabilities as IT systems located directly in the LAN.\n* The security of a VPN is based on the interaction of the physical components (computers, network switching elements), the structure of their connections (network separation, connection topology), and the configurations of the corresponding software components. However, the rules specified within the framework of the VPN security concept and their implementation using the corresponding configuration settings can only provide the desired security when the system actually installed is compatible with the system planned.\nFrequently, though, it becomes necessary to subsequently change the physical structure, for example due to a lack of detailed information during the planning phase. If the changes are not recorded, documented, and their impact on information security analysed, the security of the computers and networks connected to it may be at risk.\n* VPN users are generally on their own when using the VPN. If there are no dedicated rules for using the VPN or the users are unaware of these rules, it is possible for users to unintentionally create security gaps.\n* If legal data protection requirements are not followed properly when transmitting personal data between the components of the VPN, the organisation may be in violation of the data protection laws.

Due to a lack of virus protection measures by one of the suppliers, malware infected the local corporate network of the semiconductor manufacturer through the VPN and triggered numerous incidents.\n* The administrator of the VPN of a government agency only allowed connections encrypted using the triple-DES encryption method, but one user did not configure any encryption for her VPN client. Due to incompatible security settings, it was impossible to open a connection.\n* An additional, small ISDN system was installed in one company while configuring the VPN to compensate for unfavourable cable routes. Since this additional device was not planned for accordingly, the organisation forgot to take it into account in the VPN security concept.

Furthermore, the selection of a PSK may have an impact on the security, for example in connection with dictionary and brute force attacks.\nWhen an authentication component fails, there could be serious disruptions to operations if the contingency planning was performed poorly (e.g. no redundancy was planned) due to the users being unable to log in and use the VPN.\n", "examples": "* The use of static cryptographic keys comes in conjunction with serious security disadvantages. Since the keys are often left unchanged for long periods of time, in many cases large amounts of data are encrypted with them.

He was not instructed to inform the person responsible for security when he notices any suspicious or unusual activity.\n* A business traveller does not notice that the data stored on his notebook was secretly copied while he was in a foreign country. He did not become suspicious even though his notebook disappeared from his hotel room for a short time and then suddenly reappeared again.\n* A burglary in a branch office of a company is assumed to be a case of drug-related crime because notebooks and flat-screen monitors were the only objects stolen. The fact that confidential information and access data for the systems in the Intranet were stored on the notebooks was not considered to be important, and the person responsible for security was not informed. For this reason, the company was not prepared for the subsequent attacks to the IT systems at the company's other locations and at its headquarters. The data found on the stolen notebooks was used to plan and carry out the attack.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.142 Destruction of evidence while handling security incidents", "description": "When the action taken to handle a security incident is performed carelessly or not according to plan, then important evidence needed to investigate the incident or pursue legal action can be destroyed unintentionally.\nExamples of this include:\n* An administrator notices that the storage space available on his system has suddenly shrunk and that he cannot store any more data. To quickly free up some storage space, he immediately deleted all log files. However, these log files may have revealed during a subsequent evaluation that the server was attacked, and could have even pointed to possible sources of the attack.\n* An attacker installs a computer virus or a Trojan horse whose method of operation and objectives can only be analysed while it is running. Information on the currently active processes and the contents of main memory need to be recorded for this purpose. If the affected system is hastily shut down, then this information may not be available any more when analysing and investigating the security incident.\n* An administrator finds a process running on one server that has consumed a large amount of processor capacity over the last few days. In addition, this process writes numerous temporary files to the hard disk and sends unknown information over the Internet. If the process is hastily terminated and the unknown files deleted, then it may be impossible to determine if the process was a tool used in an attack or if confidential data was send out.\n* An important server becomes compromised because the administrator was not able to install the latest security updates due to the heavy load on the server and the lack of a free maintenance window. To avoid any possible disciplinary consequences after an intrusion, the administrator installed the missing updates before the security team was able to analyse the source of the intrusion and the damage resulting from it. A low tolerance for employee errors therefore prevented analysis of the problem.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.143 Information losses relating to copying or moving data on Samba shares", "description": "In many cases, Samba is used as a file server for Windows systems. Windows (Windows NT and higher) uses the New Technology File System (NTFS) by default as its file system. In contrast,\nSamba uses the file system of the underlying Unix operating system to manage the data. The file systems used by Windows and Unix differ greatly in some regards.\nFile systems used by Unix-like operating systems such as the third extended file system (ext3) or\nJournaling File System (JFS) are not able to reproduce certain NTFS properties. Samba is generally able to compensate for these differences, but in some cases, Samba cannot reproduce the properties of the NTFS file system objects directly. When moving or copying file system objects from one type of system to another (for example from a Windows XP system to a file share of a Samba server), some information may be lost under certain circumstances if the administrators are not aware of such effects.\nThe following information can be lost in such cases:\n* Access Control Lists (ACLs)\n* Alternate Data Streams (ADS)\n* DOS attributes\nExample 1: Access Control Lists (ACLs)\nWhen moving file system objects from an NTFS partition on a Windows system to a Samba file share, the ACL entries may be lost. Before copying, the owner of the file has the NT authorisation\n\"full access\" and the \"Everyone\" group has the NT authorisation \"read, execute\". After the file is moved, the owner of the file still has the NT authorisation \"full access\", but the \"Everyone\" group does not have any rights to the file any more.\nExample 2: Alternate Data Streams (ADS)\nWindows XP (Service Pack 2 and higher) stores so-called \"zone identifiers\" in the ADS of a file.\nThese zone identifiers allow you to detect files that were downloaded from the Internet (when downloading a file, Internet Explorer inserts the corresponding zone identifiers). Programs like\nWindows Explorer use this information to warn users when they want to execute a file downloaded from the Internet. If Internet Explorer saves the downloaded file on a Samba file share that does not record the ADS, then this information will be lost. In effect, a user will no longer be warned before trying to execute this potentially dangerous file.\nExample 3: DOS attributes\nThe DOS \"archive\" attribute of a file is reset in Windows every time the file is written to. Backup programs can use this information for incremental backups. If a Samba file share does not take this DOS attribute into account, then the backup program might not generate a new backup for a changed file.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.144 Inadequate contingency planning for a Samba server", "description": "Errors and mistakes during the contingency planning phase can disrupt the Samba operation or lead to extended downtimes. In addition to the common mistakes frequently made in the context of contingency planning, there are certain special mistakes that can be made on a Samba server that make a fast reaction to security incidents very difficult or even impossible. Some of these mistakes are described in the following:\n* If the Samba server needs to be reinstalled after an emergency (after an attack by hackers, for example), then you will need the installation packages (source text packages or binary packages) used for installation. For this reason, significant delays can arise if these packages are no longer available, because they were stored on the compromised system itself, for example. In this case, it is possible that the installation packages were also manipulated. The reinstallation of the Samba server using the manipulated packages could lead to even greater security problems.\n* If the compiler and/or installation options of the Samba server are unknown, then it can be very difficult to restore an installation offering the same functionality. If it is impossible to restore this installation, then Samba might not be able to provide optional functions that are important for the operation of the information system.\n* When recovering the system after an emergency, it may be desirable to restore the system using an older configuration. If the versions of configuration files (especially the smb.conf file) are not administered, then this may be difficult or even impossible.\n* If there is no documentation of the configuration available or the documentation available is inadequate, then it may be very difficult to restore a functioning configuration after an emergency at all. Poor or inadequate documentation can also mean configuration errors remain unnoticed at first, which can then make extensive troubleshooting necessary when problems occur.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.145 Inadequate backup of trivial database files under Samba", "description": "To be able to restore the configuration of a Samba server without any loss of information, it is necessary to back up different system components depending on the purpose of the Samba server. In general, there are no special aspects that need to be taken into account for a consistent backup of these system components.\nOne exception to this general rule are the trivial database (TDB) files used by Samba to store various information. The contents of these databases are often kept by the Samba service for a long time in the main memory (cached). For this reason, the contents located on the hard disk are not always up to date, and the sizes and time stamps of the TDB files often remain unchanged for long periods of time. If this fact is not taken into account when creating a backup of the Samba service while it is running, then there is a risk of losing data.\n", "examples": "* While backing up the files, the \"winbindd_idmap.tdb\" file was not backed up correctly. The Unix user IDs of each Windows user are stored in this file. After restoring this file, the last ten entries created by Winbind were missing. It is no longer possible to determine the user names of the Unix user IDs from 1005621 to 105630. Therefore, it is no longer possible either to determine who owned the existing files assigned to these user IDs.\n* On a Samba server in an information system, \"tdbsam\" is used to administer account information. The passwords for these accounts are stored in the file \"passdb.tdb\". A backup was not executed correctly, because the administrator used the standard Unix program \"cp\" while the Samba server was running.

Licenses for Windows Vista Enterprise can only be purchased within the framework of a volume license contract. The necessity of activating Windows Vista licenses from a volume license contract, a requirement appearing for the first time in this operating system version, is also referred to as Windows Vista Volume Activation 2.0 (as of autumn 2007). The following forms of activation are offered by Windows Vista Volume Activation\n2.0:\n* MAK (Multiple Activation Key) proxy activation,\n* MAK-independent activation, and * KMS (Key Management Server) activation.\nThere are also further differences within each of these types of activation due to the different communication routes supported for exchanging the license information with Microsoft. Activation via the internet and telephone is supported.\nCertain rules must be followed to activate a Windows Vista license. If one of these rules is violated, the Windows Vista client automatically switches to the RFM mode (Reduced Functionality Mode). In the RFM mode, the Vista client will not operate properly until a Windows Vista license is successfully activated for the Vista client. Microsoft has eliminated the RFM with the release of\nService Pack 1. Instead of switching to the RFM mode, Windows Vista now displays corresponding warnings.\nA Windows Vista client will enter the RFM mode if one of the following violations occurs. In this case, detailed criteria have been made public:\n* activation is not performed within a grace period of 30 days after the installation of Windows Vista.\n* reactivation is not performed within 210 days after the last activation (when the KMS activation method was used).\nA Windows Vista client will also enter the RFM mode if one of the following violations occurs, but in this case, only vague criteria have been made public:\n* reactivation is not performed within 30 days after making significant changes to the hardware, for example after replacing a hard drive in the case of KMS activation. Additional details on significant hardware changes can be found in the Technical Market Bulletin\nProduct Activation for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 published by the manufacturer Microsoft in September 2007.\n* manipulation of the activation process or of license files, although more detailed specifications have not been made public.\n* compromised product key\nThe term product key may refer to the MAK key or to the KMS key. Compromised in this case means lost, stolen, misused, illegally copied, defective (due to a manufacturer error), or invalid (since the key is a beta or test key). More detailed information has not been released.\nThe vagueness of the criteria means there is a possibility of obtaining false positives. False positive in the context of activation means that a Vista client has been erroneously placed in the RFM mode. Possible reasons for a false positive include, for example, incorrectly assuming that a product key is compromised or that the licensing files have been manipulated.\nThe vague criteria also indicate that it is possible to lose control of a Vista client when performing maintenance, because it is not known which hardware modifications require reactivation. If valid license information is not available quickly for reactivation, there is a danger of the client entering the RFM mode.\nThere is a risk that the restrictive Windows Vista Volume Activation process designed by the manufacturer could also lead to the loss of functionality of the Vista clients through no fault of the administrator. In this case, it is impossible to use the Vista clients and the applications running on them.\nIn turn, the loss of functionality of a Vista client may lead to the loss of functionality of an application that is essential to complete a given task in a specialised procedure or business process.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.147 Lack of centralisation with peer-to-peer", "description": "In many IT environments, central servers are used to exchange information. The emails from the clients are sent to email servers and made available to the recipient clients. Files are provided centrally on a file server for authorised users, and print servers allow users to access a central printer.\nWhen peer-to-peer services are used, you do not need a separate server to exchange data, and the clients (peers) provide each other with the shared resources. The peers in this case do not need to be located in the same LAN and can be distributed all over the world via a public network such as the Internet.\nThe following problems can arise from a lack of centralisation:\nLack of control by the security gateway (firewall) and local packet filter\nPeer-to-peer communication with external communication partners located outside of the LAN requires a connection between the internal peer and the external peer or the external peer to be allowed to open a connection to the peer in the LAN. However, if any type of communication connection is allowed to be opened, then the packet filter in the security gateway will not be able to reject undesired packets in advance any more. Since port numbers are often negotiated dynamically, restricting the number of open ports to just a few ports would hinder peer-to-peer communication.\nProtection mechanisms, for example those that prohibit the peers from opening direct connections to the Internet and require them to use a proxy instead would be ineffective. If external communication partners are allowed to connect directly to IT systems in the LAN, then they could execute denial-of-service attacks on the clients or search for vulnerabilities by scanning the ports, for example.\nLack of malware filters\nWhen exchanging information with other users using peer-to-peer services, the corresponding clients need to open a direct data connection between each other. This allows the user to send files to different users, for example. When using a server, for example to exchange information via email, the server should scan the emails received for malware before it forwards the emails. This additional control instance is not available when using peer-to-peer services. If malware is transmitted using peer-to-peer services directly from a peer in the Internet to a peer in the LAN and the virus protection is inadequate, then it is possible for malware to infect the internal clients over this connection, and then to infect other IT systems in the LAN.\nUncontrolled flow of information\nWith peer-to-peer services, it is possible to transmit information without it being filtered centrally by a server. For example, if an email server is configured so that emails marked as \"confidential\" cannot be sent to external parties, then it is possible to overcome this hurdle using peer-to-peer services.\nTo be able to use peer-to-peer services, a suitable peer-to-peer application must be installed on the client. Such applications are available on the Internet, for example for sharing files. Such peer-to-peer applications could be infected with a Trojan horse that logs all keyboard input of the user and sends this information directly to the Internet using the peer-to-peer service, for example. If SSL is used for encryption by the peer-to-peer service, then it will be very difficult to detect such a Trojan horse because it will be impossible to read the information flowing between the attacker and the peer.\nInadequate logging capabilities\nA log of who has communicated with whom and which information was exchanged can only be recorded with significant effort when peer-to-peer services are used. It is also easier to manipulate the log data when it is stored on a peer than when it is stored on a central server.\nEncryption\nFor the encrypted exchange of information, additional information needs to be exchanged with every user who wants to communicate. In the case of symmetric encryption, both communication partners must know the shared secret key. However, even when asymmetric encryption is used in which encryption is performed using a public key and decryption using a private key, the sender cannot always be sure that the public key actually came from the recipient.\nIf certificates are not checked, an attacker could forge the certificates and place himself/herself directly between the peers (man-in-the-middle attack). Since a central instance that is responsible for distributing the keys and can guarantee their authenticity is not often available for peer-to-peer services, the certificates are not checked in many cases.\nComplex user administration\nIn the case of internal and public peer-to-peer services, the peers who want to allow the other peers to access their resources must share these resources. To protect this information against access by unauthorised persons, the shares can be protected using user names and passwords, for example.\nIf large amounts of information will be shared by various users, then the assignments specifying who is allowed to access what can quickly become complicated. It is also often impossible to use central authentication services (single sign-ons) unless support is provided for this purpose by installing additional peer-to-peer applications.\nSearching and version maintenance\nIn contrast to server-based networks, the resources in peer-to-peer networks are distributed among numerous IT systems. The search for certain information, for example a file, can be very difficult if the user does not know on which IT system the file is located.\nThere are also often several different versions of a file available. They arise because a user will usually copy the file he wants to edit to the local IT system and then makes the changed file available on his shares. In this case, each user may maintain different versions of the file on his or her IT system, but it will be impossible to determine which of the versions available throughout the network is the most recent version.\nLack of bandwidth on the peers\nIn a server-based network, the network connection to the servers generally provides enough bandwidth to handle the requests from the clients. In the case of a server-based network, it is possible to plan the required bandwidth and dimension the network accordingly by taking the services the clients need to use into account.\nIn the case of peer-to-peer networks, though, it is very difficult to plan how much bandwidth will be needed. In general, the peers providing most of the information at a given time will be accessed most frequently. The connections to these systems will become overloaded, and essential services will not have enough bandwidth available any more. If another peer provides more recent information or information that is needed more frequently, then the load placed on the previous peer will drop very quickly, and the connection to the LAN of the peer now accessed more frequently is now inadequate. It is therefore impossible to calculate the required bandwidth in advance when the peer accessed most frequently changes regularly, in contrast to a server whose required bandwidth can be calculated in advance.\nLack of specialisation of the IT systems\nThe requirements placed on a server are specified in advance. A server is then purchased based on these requirements and as a general rule is only used for the prescribed task. Servers are also typically installed in air-conditioned server rooms, in contrast to standard IT systems, which are usually operated in an office environment. The servers can only perform the prescribed tasks efficiently through the high degree of specialisation.\nPeers on which several users can work in parallel are not designed for higher loads as a general rule. If the information is stored on standard hard disks instead of on special server hard disks, for example, a high load can significantly shorten the service life of the hard disks.\nIn general, additional safeguards are implemented on servers, and special emphasis is placed on the configuration that is critical to security. High requirements in terms of the availability are often met using redundant hard disks, for example. These security features are generally not available on standard IT systems.\nAnonymity\nIt is not always possible at first glance to immediately determine who exchanged information when external peer-to-peer services are used. A peer that was accessible yesterday using a certain IP address may use a different IP address for access on the next day.\nFor this reason, it cannot be ruled out that the IP address of a peer with which short text messages\n(messaging) and information (file sharing) were exchanged at one time is now being used by another peer.\nIf a user now sends information to a supposedly known user, then unauthorised persons may also receive this information.\nLegal aspects\nPublic peer-to-peer services were developed to provide documents more efficiently to other users for the purpose of discussion. Peer-to-peer services are also often used to distribute copyrighted content on file trading networks. If illegal or copyrighted information is downloaded from the LAN of a government agency or company using peer-to-peer services, then there could be damage to the reputation of the organisation in the eyes of the public as well as legal consequences.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.148 Poor planning of the virtualisation", "description": "The introduction of virtualisation servers in a computer centre means that a new class of IT systems must be put into service. A virtualisation server is usually not only a server allowing for operating virtual IT systems. Rather, it integrates the virtual IT systems into the computer centre and, in so doing, it controls their connection to further infrastructure elements such as networks and storage networks. From the virtual IT systems' point of view, the virtualisation server is therefore a part of the computer centre infrastructure.\nIn a classic IT infrastructure, the (physical) IT systems are often administrated in a specialised process. The individual structure elements of the IT infrastructure are operated by administrators specialised and focused on the IT systems supported by them. On the contrary, individual structure elements of the previously separate infrastructure are consolidated in a virtualisation server in a virtualised IT infrastructure. This may possibly shift a part of the operating responsibility for these computer centre resources from the specialised administrators to the administrators of the virtualisation servers.\nThe introduction of virtualisation also changes the perspective on an information system as a whole. If infrastructure components and a large number of (virtual) servers and (virtual) workstations are mapped within a virtualisation server, the differences between a physical and a logical information system are unperceivable. For this reason, the logical structure can no longer be defined clearly.\nMissing or poor planning of the roles and responsibilities\nVirtualisation servers also usually contain a large part of the infrastructure components required for operating a virtual IT system in virtual form. These infrastructure components such as switches or network-attached storage systems are otherwise provided by dedicated components. This means that network connections of a virtualised IT system are not established, administrated, and monitored by a switch, as usual, but normally by the virtualisation server. The same applies to storage capacity in storage networks and other resources.\nIf the way the servers are to be integrated into the computer centre from a technical and organisational point of view is not planned when using the virtualisation servers, there is the risk that\n* the responsibilities for different areas such as applications, operating systems, and network components will not be clearly defined,\n* the responsibilities for different areas will overlap, or * a matching rights structure for separating administrative access options for the different areas will be not present.\nFor infrastructure elements such as switches or storage networks, different persons with separate roles are frequently responsible in the classic computer centre. However, these role concepts for administration may be undermined by poorly designed virtualisation. For example, the administrators of the virtual infrastructure are granted comprehensive access to the guest systems, to their communication links, and to the information processed and provided by these systems. If ambiguous or even no regulations at all regarding the distribution and delegation of the tasks between the administrators are imposed or if important aspects are overlooked and not taken into consideration during the planning phase, responsible persons may lack the required information. As a consequence, errors such as\n* poor determination of the resource requirements for the virtualisation infrastructure,\n* poor analysis of the performance requirements regarding the systems to be virtualised,\n* poor planning and procurement of infrastructure components for networks and storage networks,\n* poor adaptation of the infrastructure components to the virtual infrastructure, and\n* a lack of integration of the virtualisation software, as well as its virtual infrastructure components and the virtual IT systems into existing monitoring systems may cause comprehensive, negative consequences for the entire information system.\nMissing planning of the use of virtualisation servers\nIf it is not ensured that the virtual IT systems are operated on uniformly configured virtualisation servers and therefore have a uniform infrastructure, problems may occur while operating the virtual IT systems. The virtualisation technology Live Migration shall be mentioned as an example. It allows migration of a virtual IT system from one virtualisation server to another virtualisation server:\n* If a virtual IT system is migrated in the virtualisation structure, it may possibly access resources it should not be able to access for reasons of confidentiality and integrity.\n* On the other hand, a virtual IT system may no longer be able to access a required resource such as name resolution (DNS) after Live Migration due to a poorly planned virtualisation infrastructure. This may have direct consequences for the availability of a virtual IT system.\nIf the hardware equipment of the virtualisation servers is not planned in detail and if there are no specifications regarding the procurement of the required hardware components, components incompatible with the selected virtualisation product may be procured. This may entail disadvantages for manufacturer support regarding the selected product. Moreover, it is possible that certain processor properties such as Intel VT and AMD-V absolutely required for operating the virtualisation solution are missing.\nIf the hardware components procured for a farm of virtualisation servers are not equipped uniformly, the availability and integrity of the virtual IT systems may be endangered. For example, differing processor equipment of the virtualisation servers may cause stability issues of the virtual IT systems. If certain processor properties are not available on a virtualisation server when a virtual IT system is migrated to this server using Live Migration, the virtual IT system may crash.\nIncorrect network integration\nRegarding computer centre operations, certain procedures for integrating servers and similar systems into the network infrastructure have emerged. These procedures, e.g. MAC filters, serve for protecting the availability, as well as the integrity and confidentiality of the network connections. If these procedures are not taken into account and not adapted properly, it is possible that safeguards suitable for physical systems have adverse effects on the operation of virtual systems. If MAC filters are configured improperly on the switch ports of the virtualisation servers, some virtualisation functions such as Live Migration, i.e. the migration of running virtual IT systems between virtualisation servers, may be inoperable. In such a case, the migrated virtual machine loses its network connection, since its (virtual) MAC address is rejected on the switch port of the new virtualisation server.\nImproper integration into storage networks\nThe particularities of the virtualisation servers when accessing storage networks must already be taken into consideration appropriately in the planning stages. Virtualisation servers require access to all iSCSI and Fibre Channel resources of a storage network required for operating the virtual IT systems. Normally, virtual IT systems do not use their own iSCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces in order to access such resources, but use the corresponding interfaces of the virtualisation servers to this end. Therefore, the virtualisation servers also require access to resources which are actually only intended for the virtual IT systems, since the virtualisation servers may not be able to provide the virtual systems with these resources otherwise. Therefore, if ambiguous regulations are imposed prior to commissioning or if functional and time requirements are not addressed in the planning stages, failures regarding availability, confidentiality, and integrity are possible during the further lifecycle of the virtualisation environment.\nIf virtualisation servers are to be used in the computer centre, there is the risk that a segmentation of the storage network (SAN) which is not adapted to virtualisation may cause risks. For example, virtual IT systems are no longer able to access required resources if they are migrated between virtualisation servers. The availability of the services provided by the virtual IT systems is endangered. On the other hand, poor planning of the storage network integration may cause the granting of excessively comprehensive access rights to the storage networks. This may endanger the confidentiality of the information stored to these storage networks.\nLack of planning of the use of virtual IT systems\nPlanning errors may also occur in other areas where existing procedures are not checked when virtualisation is to be used. If the procedures usual in the computer centre are not adapted in the fields of server procurement and provision, as well as operating system installation, one or several of the following problems may occur:\n* The lack of suitability of individual operating systems, services, or applications regarding the selected virtualisation environment can never be ruled out completely. Moreover, adaptations of the virtualisation servers to the virtual IT systems operated on them and/or their operating systems and applications may be required. This could remain undiscovered in the event of inadequate verification performed by qualified skilled personnel, as well as an inappropriate synchronisation of all persons involved in the project. As a consequence, performance issues or processing errors may occur during further operation of the virtualisation servers and/or the virtual IT systems that are based on incompatibilities of the applications used regarding the virtualisation solution used. This particularly endangers the integrity and availability of the information processed on the virtual IT systems.\n* If it is not checked whether the applications to be operated on virtual IT systems require certain hardware components (such as software protection modules (Dongles) or ISDN cards) that may be used in combination with the selected virtualisation solution, this may result in significant delays when installing these IT systems. It may also be possible that such a system cannot be virtualised at all or a component compatible with the virtualisation solution must be procured first.\n* If virtual IT systems (virtual servers, workstations, and switches) are not inventoried completely, there is no overview of the IT systems actually operated in the computer centre. This may result in the following:\n* a lack of present operating system or application licenses, for example, resulting in the organisation being under-licensed.\n* the operation of IT systems without any available operating documentation or not included in the security concepts of the organisation,\n* the operation of IT systems, the purpose of which is unknown (see also T 5.66 Unauthorised connection of IT systems to a network),\n* the initial operation of IT systems without the required planning and operating preparations, the withdrawal from operation or the deletion from inventory lists of IT systems in contradiction to the general rules of the organisation.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.149 Insufficient storage capacity for virtual IT systems", "description": "Virtualisation servers require disk space provided either locally in the virtualisation server itself or in a storage network in order to operate the virtual IT systems. If the storage capacities required for the aforementioned are planned insufficiently, there are comprehensive risks regarding the availability of the virtual IT systems and the integrity of the information processed by these systems. This is particularly applicable if special virtualisation functions such as snapshots or the overbooking of disk space are used. Bottlenecks must not only refer to the disk space of hard disks or in storage networks, but also the internal memory (RAM).\nVirtualisation functions such as snapshots occupy additional disk space\nFreezing and storing operational conditions of virtual IT systems (Snapshots) require sufficient disk space. For example, the content of the virtual bulk storages and possibly also the conditions of main memory and processor are written to the hard disk when a snapshot is created. Additionally, a differential file is generated during the runtime of the guest system for some virtualisation solutions. Together with the original condition of the data present before the snapshot was created on the virtual data medium, this differential file forms the current content of the virtual hard disk. Standby functions which allow the stopping of virtual machines during live operations also use a similar technology and therefore occupy storage resources until operation is continued.\nOverbooking of disk space\nAnother particularity of virtual environments is that disk space can be overbooked. This means no fix disk space is reserved when a virtual IT system is assigned a certain storage capacity. Instead, the disk space is only assigned to the virtual IT system in the physically present resources when it is actually used by the virtual IT system. In this case, one hundred gigabytes are visible to the virtual system, but it actually only requires the currently used disk space, for example.\nThe overbooked disk space can be implemented by a growing file container stored on a hard disk physically installed in the virtualisation server or in a storage network, for example. This container becomes larger and larger the more it is used. If data is deleted within the virtual IT system using this container, the container is normally not reduced in size automatically, however.\nRegardless of whether the data medium the container of the virtual IT system was stored to is present locally or in the network, its size is limited by the physically available disk space. Without prudent planning of the required maximum capacities, this may easily result in problems. If the storage has been overbooked excessively, it is possible all the free space will be taken up sooner than it should be. The memory requirements of the virtual IT system can then not be covered in the physical medium and an error situation occurs for the virtual machine affected by this. This is because no additional memory may be provided for the guest system by the virtualisation server, although free memory appears to be usable from the virtualised IT system's point of view. In such a situation, many virtualisation products make do with only allowing read access to the virtual hard disk affected by the overbooking in order to protect the data present up to this point in time. As a consequence, data on these virtual hard disks may become inconsistent. The virtual IT system may possibly even fail completely if the operating system of the virtual IT system is not able to compensate the occurring errors, for example. Other virtualisation solutions automatically create a snapshot of the affected systems and then shut these systems down when the physical memory is no longer available.\nThis approach disturbs the availability of the services of these virtual IT systems. Moreover, the operation of all guest systems ran by the virtualisation server is impaired similarly if all disposable physical resources of the virtualisation server are exhausted.\n", "examples": "An internationally operating trading company uses an ERP system (Enterprise Resource Planning) in order to automate and support different processes such as purchasing, amongst other things. In order to provide the field service agents of the company with access to the ERP system, the company provides a terminal server farm used by the agents in order to book their purchases and to participate in the corporate communication (intranet and email). The platform must be available at all times, since the agents work in the field of commodity futures and therefore the exact time of the purchasing activities is decisive in order to achieve a good price.\nFor cost-related reasons, the management of the company decides to operate the terminal server farm and the ERP systems as virtual IT systems in the future. While analysing the existing physical systems, the planning team determines that the hard disks of the existing systems are only utilised insignificantly. However, some database systems occasionally require more space when the purchasing figures are analysed at monthly intervals. This disk space is immediately released once the analysis is finished.\nMoreover, using the snapshot function of the virtualisation servers when changing the ERP system versions is planned. Since errors occasionally occur during the updates, this function is to be used in order to be able to quickly undo the changes. A time-consuming recovery of the pre-update status may quickly have adverse effects on the business success in the field of commodity futures. For this reason, the snapshot functions of the virtualisation servers are an important factor for introducing the virtualisation technology in this company.\nSince the hard disk space of the physical systems is only utilised insignificantly, it is assumed that it is sufficiently dimensioned as a reserve for the snapshots. Therefore, they decided to only design a storage capacity as is currently available in the physical systems as a whole in the storage network configured for the virtual IT systems. This was deemed sufficient, since it was not possible to consume more disk space than actually physically present when updating the physical systems.\nShortly before the end of a month, the ERP software is updated. For this, the ERP systems themselves, as well as the terminal servers must be updated, since the new and urgently required functions can only be used if the client software on the terminal servers is replaced as well. In order to prevent possible malfunctions, a snapshot of all systems, the ERP systems, and the terminal servers was created prior to the update. The snapshot was created after the monthly operating figures had been generated in order to quickly have the operating figures available based on the old software in the event of an update failure.\nAs of this point in time, all changes to the hard disk containers of the virtual IT systems are written to a differential file and the memory consumption in the storage network increases by leaps and bounds. It was not taken into consideration that the files replaced during the process of updating the software are not physically overwritten by the snapshot, but continue to be present in the snapshot. Therefore, the memory requirements for updating the virtual IT systems doubled.\nWithin the framework of the monthly analysis, the disk space in the storage network is completely exhausted so that no further data can be written. At this point, it was again not taken into consideration that the space for the analysis must be re-assigned in the differential file. The administrator of the virtual IT system responsible for the analysis recognised the scarce disk space in the virtual hard disk and therefore deleted the old analysis before creating the new one. However, this does not have any effect on the physically occupied disk space, since the physical disk space used for analysing the old data is now part of the snapshot.\nThe virtualisation software automatically protects the virtual IT systems against a loss of data and data inconsistency by stopping the virtual IT systems. This causes the complete and simultaneous failure of all terminal servers and ERP systems. The agents are completely cut off from the corporate communication and cannot be informed about the failure. This causes a delay in the transactions performed in commodity futures and the company must pay significantly higher prices for the purchased goods.\nBefore it was possible to revive the failed systems, free disk space had to be created for the virtual IT systems. The administrators had the choice of either resetting the virtual IT systems to the snapshot or expanding the memory in the storage network, Since the terminal server farm and the ERP had to be available quickly, they decided to reset the systems to the snapshot. Therefore, the payroll costs for updating the systems had to be written off.\nAfter the disk space actually required in order to update the ERP software with the help of snapshots had been determined properly, the storage capacity of the storage network was then expanded. It was only possible to use the urgently required function extensions of the updated software after this expansion had been performed.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.150 Improper integration of guest tools in virtual IT systems", "description": "With the help of guest tools, e.g. the Citrix XenTools or the VMware Tools, the administrator is able to control and administrate the virtual IT systems in the virtualisation infrastructure. Furthermore, these programs integrate drivers and services for the communication of the virtualised operating systems with the host.\nThe guest tools are used to implement different functions, e.g.:\n* synchronisation of the system time of a virtual machine with the host,\n* request of main memory in the virtual IT system and sharing of this memory for other guests on the virtualisation server (ballooning),\n* shutdown of the operating system of the virtual IT system without login,\n* optimisation of virtual hard disks (thin provisioning).\nThe guest tools have comprehensive authorisations regarding system files and services in the context of the virtual machine in order to allow for the functions described. These functions may contradict an established authorisation concept, as well as other requirements regarding the virtual environment if the existing concepts and requirements are not taken into consideration and implemented while planning the installation of the guest tools. This way, it may be possible to use functions incompatible with the organisation's policies.\nShutting down a virtual IT system without the required authorisation\nFor example, if it was specified in an organisation that virtual and physical servers must only be shut down upon login of the responsible administrator and stating the reasons for the shutdown as a matter of principle, the guest tools may be used in order to bypass these specifications. By using the guest tools, the administrator of a virtualisation server may shut down any other virtual IT system.\nFor this, the administrator him/herself must not necessarily be an authorised administrator of the corresponding virtual IT system. This way, the administrators of the virtualisation servers may undermine the policies and regulations regarding the virtual IT systems for the use of systems and thereby endanger the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the virtual IT systems.\nMoreover, there are virtualisation products (such as VMware Workstation, VMware Server) with comprehensive functions in order to be integrated into a development environment. Here, additional functions exceeding the options mentioned above are available for the guest tools in virtual IT systems. This way, scripts can be stored to a virtual IT system and controlled by guest tools from the outside for testing purposes. For this, no interaction with and no authentication at the virtual IT system itself is required. The actions are only initiated by the virtualisation software and/or the hypervisor and the guest tools. If virtual IT systems from development environments are now transferred to the virtual infrastructure for productive operations, security gaps may be created in the productive environment, since the tools and interfaces specifically designed for the development environment continue to be effective in the productive environment.\n", "examples": "A government agency plans to update a complex client/server application. An external consulting company is commissioned with the update. The update steps are developed and tested in a virtual environment representing a complete image of the productive environment. The test systems are copies of the productive systems provided in an isolated network.\nOne of the external consultants is responsible for updating the client application. The installation of the application on the client is rather complex. Moreover, certain defined configuration steps must be performed on the server during each new installation so that the new client version is operable. Once the data on the server has been migrated, clients with an old software version may no longer access the server.\nIn order not to have to perform the same configuration steps over and over again, the external consultant created scripts. On the one hand, these are designed to newly configure the client during every restart and, on the other hand, to install and execute scripts on the servers using the guest tools.\nThe responsible head of division wants to obtain information about the project's progress and asks one of her employees to show her the client. Since no installation packages for the client software are available in the productive environment, the employee decides to copy the virtual workplace system of the external consultant. He transfers the system to the productive network and starts it in order to show his supervisor.\nIn the background, the scripts of the external consultant integrated in the client are enabled and the productive server of the government agency is updated to the new version using these scripts. The employees can no longer access the server, resulting in a loss of production of several hours, since data recovery must be performed.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.151 Lack of manufacturer support of applications regarding the use of virtual IT systems", "description": "The influence of the virtualisation technology on the design of computer centres outside of the mainframe world (IBM Z-Series, Siemens BS2000, SUN Enterprise 25000) only started to increase a few years ago and productive IT systems are virtualised to an increasing extent only since about 2005. Before, virtual IT systems were predominantly used in development and test environments. There is a large number of different virtualisation products additionally based on different technical approaches (server and operating system virtualisation). Therefore, no virtual IT system has been standardised up to this point in time in the way this is possible for IT systems based on x86 or x64 hardware.\nNormally, applications are approved for a certain combination of operating system and hardware platform by their manufacturers. This means that they support the user of an application in troubleshooting, for example, if the application is operated with the corresponding operating system on the approved hardware platform. However, since the hardware platform \"virtual IT system\" has not yet been standardised, the application manufacturers are not able to make any general statements as to the extent to which the installation of their application on any virtual IT system is supported.\nVirtual IT systems may be operated on the basis of completely different virtualisation technologies\n(server or operating system virtualisation) and therefore may be characterised by greatly differing properties. In virtual IT systems based on operating system virtualisation (SUN Solaris Zones,\nParallels Virtuozzo), i.e. that may represent multiple instances of a single operating system, different, quasi operating system software libraries or different operating system cores cannot be used at all or only to a very limited extent, for example. Such a limitation normally cannot be found in virtual systems based on complete server virtualisation (e.g. Citrix XenServer, Microsoft HyperV, QEMU, Sun VirtualBox, VMware ESX) so that a generally applicable statement for all conceivable virtual IT systems regardless of which virtualisation technology cannot be made.\nFor the aforementioned reasons, manufacturers do not generally approve their applications to be operated on virtual IT systems, but only grant these approvals for certain combinations of operating system and specific virtualisation products if applicable. If it is not checked whether such an approval is present, there is the risk that support is rejected or restricted in the event of difficulties.\n", "examples": "A large-scale company operates a comprehensive ERP system consisting of numerous servers. The\nERP system consists of several database systems and approximately 30 application and 80 web servers. The company concluded a maintenance and support agreement with the manufacturer of the ERP system containing the promise of the manufacturer to provide support for occurring problems. The support agreement is subject to the condition that the ERP systems must be operated with the\nWindows Server 2003 operating system on typical hardware. For virtual systems, the manufacturer reserves a case-by-case review and does not issue any general approval.\nThe company wants to replace the server systems the ERP is operated on with new systems, since the existing systems have gotten relatively old in the meantime and hardware failures occur frequently. The administrators responsible report that the individual servers, especially the application and web servers, are not utilised significantly and that load peaks do not occur simultaneously on all systems, but are distributed to the systems over the course of a day. For these reasons, the decision to virtualise the application and web servers and to operate these in a virtual infrastructure consisting of several virtualisation servers is made. For the application servers, the company selects a server virtualisation solution, and for the web servers, it selects a product based on operating system virtualisation. Operating system virtualisation is deemed specifically appropriate for providing a large number of web servers, since major consolidation effects can be achieved in so doing, i.e. a very high number of virtual instances can be operated on one virtualisation server. For server virtualisation, the administrators do not expect any problems that may be attributed to the virtualisation software and assume that no virtualisation-related failures will occur.\nAfter the ERP systems were virtualised without even consulting the manufacturer of the ERP systems, the ERP application runs without any failures for a certain time. After a couple of months, an employee recognises errors occurring in the storage module of the ERP software, however. It is determined that the incoming and outgoing goods entered by the warehouse employees using a web server were processed incorrectly in the warehouse. The ERP system now automatically triggers purchase orders although there still are sufficient goods in the warehouse. For other goods urgently required for production, the ERP system shows excessive stock levels, resulting in no replenishment orders being triggered and the production standing still. The company suffers damages to a considerable amount due to the loss of production.\nThe administrators of the ERP system address the problem and assume that there is a transmission issue in the interaction between web server and application server resulting in the incorrect processing. However, they are not able to find any solution and they consult the manufacturer. The manufacturer asks for the configuration of the ERP servers and automatically generated reports and reviews these in order to be able to narrow down and eliminate the error.\nAfter the manufacturer of the ERP systems determined that the servers are operated on virtual platforms, the manufacturer informs the company that the ERP system runs on a platform that was not approved and thus not supported. The manufacturer determined a timing problem as the cause and refuses any further processing, since it is expected that the problem is related to the virtualisation of the systems. The manufacturer requests the company to reconstruct the operational scenario on non-virtualised hardware in order to rule out virtualisation as a cause of the problem.\nThe company is now forced to rent a large number of physical servers for reconstruction of the operational scenario. This reconstruction is very complex and time-consuming. Moreover, this significantly delays troubleshooting.\nIt turns out that the error also occurs on the physical systems and that it can therefore be largely ruled out that the server virtualisation was the cause of the error. Subsequently, the ERP manufacturer continues its efforts and the problem is resolved completely upon in-depth analysis.\nThe company using the ERP system now demands compensation from the software manufacturer for the costs incurred as a result of reproducing the error on physical servers, as well as the lost working time and the loss of production during that time that occurred while designing the parallel environment. According to the company, the solution of the problem was delayed unnecessarily by the software manufacturer, since it turned out that the virtualisation was not the cause of the problem. The manufacturer in turn refers to the wording of the maintenance and support agreement and denies any liability. Moreover, the manufacturer emphasises that the timing problem that lead to the assumption that the problem that occurred was connected to the virtualisation was only determined as a gesture of goodwill. The manufacturer could also have completely refused to processing the problem. The manufacturer of the ERP software wins the subsequent court proceedings.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.152 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of the use of DNS", "description": "If planning the use of DNS is neglected, such neglect can result in problems and security gaps during live operation. Numerous network services and applications require DNS in order to function properly. Thus, DNS is needed by communication partners in order to find out the IP address of a recipient's e-mail server. If the DNS servers are not accessible, these services cannot be used or can only be used to a limited extent. In the worst case, a security gap caused by poor planning can result in the DNS servers becoming compromised.\nDNS server infrastructure\nThe availability and performance capability of DNS servers depends, amongst other things, on the distribution in the network. Problems which might arise from planning the infrastructure inadequately include:\n* Incorrect arrangement of DNS servers:\nGenerally, when a domain name is registered, at least two servers which are used as advertising DNS servers (see S 2.450 Introduction to DNS basics) for this domain are specified. If these two advertising DNS servers are within the same network segment, it is possible that the failure of the gateway connecting this segment with the rest of the network causes the name resolution of the entire domain to fail. Finally, this means that it is no longer possible to access services such as web servers, e-mail and even remote administration access.\n* Long response times:\nIf the performance capacity of the advertising and/or resolving (see S 2.450 Introduction to DNS basics) DNS servers or the bandwidth of the network has not been dimensioned sufficiently, this often results in long response times or timeouts. If there is no prioritisation of the network traffic, it can happen that unimportant network traffic and network traffic that is not time-critical places excessive demands on the bandwidth.\n* Distance:\nThe more network components are between a DNS server and the requesting hosts, the more often the packets must be processed. This increases the response time and unnecessary load is placed on the network.\nUnsuitable DNS server software\nOutdated and/or less tested software often contains known software vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious software (malware). Thus, the risk of successful attacks increases significantly.\nIn addition, problems can occur if the same software is used for all DNS servers. If, in this case, a\nDNS server is compromised due to a software vulnerability, this gap can be exploited on any other\nDNS server. If an information system, however, intends to use different DNS server software components, there is a risk of them only being compatible to a limited extent. In addition, this leads to an increase in the time and effort required for administration.\nDNS servers and security gateways\nThe planning of the DNS servers has an effect on the configuration of security gateways and packet filters. If the rules allowing DNS traffic in the network are defined too generously, this might make an attack possible under certain circumstances. However, if the rules have been formulated too restrictively, legitimate clients might not be able to send requests to the DNS servers and are impaired when using services such as e-mail, FTP or the like.\nDivision of the name space\nThe domain information on the name space of an information system contains all information on the structure of the internal network. Often, making all the information accessible to the general public is not desired. For this purpose, the name space can be divided into an internal (resolving DNS server) and a publicly accessible (advertising DNS server) area. If such division is not taken into account when planning the use of DNS, problems as described in T 5.154 DNS information leakage might arise.\nCryptography\nDNS can be protected using cryptographic mechanisms, for example using TSIG (Trusted Security Transaction Group) and DNSSEC (DNS Security). Like for any cryptographic applications, the cryptographic keys are secret material. If these keys are published, these cryptographic mechanisms no longer ensure any protection. If the planning does not include clear rules as to what extent cryptography is to be used, such lack of clarity can, amongst other things, cause the following problems:\n* The field of application of individual mechanisms such as TSIG and DNSSEC was not specified. Thus, it is not clear if and, if so, between which partners unencrypted e-mail communication is allowed.\n* The access rights to the files containing the cryptographic keys are defined too generously. Thus, each user who has logged in on the computer can read and change the files.\n* The exchange of the keys was not planned; thus, the keys are transmitted using unprotected network connections.\n", "examples": "* In 2001, the domain of a large software company was practically brought to a standstill for several hours. This was caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack on the router connecting the DNS servers for the domain with the Internet. Any DNS-based communication was stopped. Only computers whose resolvers had buffered the required domain information could establish a connection.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.153 Improper protection of the transmission route in a terminal server environment", "description": "Terminal servers allow applications to be executed centrally on an IT system by physically remote clients. Depending on the requirements, the clients may access the terminal server via LAN or even using public networks such as the Internet. If the information required for this is transmitted without any protection between the clients and the servers, sensitive information may be tapped or entire sessions on the terminal server may be taken over, particularly when using public networks. If a session is taken over, an attacker could gain all user rights of the user without having to overcome the security barriers of every single service.\nThe following information transmitted between the terminal server and the clients may be tapped or modified:\n* authentication information,\n* user input sent from the clients to the terminal servers,\n* display information output on the clients,\n* data from the clipboard, and * file transfers between the local client drives and the server.\nFurthermore, information is also transmitted to devices of the terminal redirected to the server, e.g.\n* audio devices,\n* serial or parallel interfaces,\n* USB devices, and\n* printers.\nOlder terminal server services, e.g. the Microsoft Windows Terminal Server 2000, only use unidirectional, protocol-internal encryption for secure transportation of the user input in their default configuration. However, this information is received by the terminal server and returned to be displayed on the terminal in a graphical form without any encryption.\nIn Windows Server 2003 and higher, Microsoft uses bidirectional encryption in the default configuration. For this, an encryption method must be negotiated between the client and the server in advance. When using the \"client compatible mode\", the client defines the method to be selected, for example. If an insufficient method with encryption procedures deemed insecure or keys that are too short are selected, the communication between the client and the server may also be read or modified.\nX-Window does not provide for any encryption between the server and the client. Without additional mechanisms such as SSH tunnelling or VPN the flow of data may also be manipulated or viewed.\n", "examples": "An employee uses the ERP system of the company with the help of a terminal server client at her telecommuter workplace. The system administrator configured this workplace with bidirectional encryption, but the terminal server also permits connections with unidirectional cryptographic protection. Due to accidental operation, the employee deletes the configuration of her client, but is able to restore the connection since she knows the access information. In doing so, due to a lack of technical knowledge, she does not notice the insecure configuration of the return channel. An industrial spy manages to eavesdrop on the session via the internet resulting in the spy obtaining confidential figures from the company's balance sheet.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.154 Improper applications for the use on terminal servers", "description": "Applications not capable of being installed and operated on a terminal server are becoming increasingly scarce. Nevertheless, it may happen that individual applications in a complex software landscape cannot be installed on terminal servers. If verifications as to whether the applications have been developed for a multi-user environment were not performed in advance, applications may fail, become unstable, or even worse, unforeseeable inconsistencies in the database may occur.\nTransmitting multimedia content often constitutes a particular challenge for a terminal server environment. If audio and video data, or even real-time 3D graphics (e.g. in the field of CAD) are transmitted, the flow of data to be transmitted to the terminals increases significantly. If multimedia content is to be transmitted, users may be impaired significantly in their work with the IT system in the event of poor design and planning of the existing resources. As a consequence, all sessions on the overloaded terminal server may freeze or data connections may be interrupted. Even if such complex applications were not designed, but accessing these applications (e.g. via a browser plug-in) is possible due to a misconfiguration, these problems may occur.\nExample\nA company wants to migrate from a client/server architecture to a terminal server architecture. The persons in charge only recognise that the individually developed ERP system crashes sporadically after the productive system has been rolled out. Additionally, the database used by the warehouse management module increasingly contains erroneous or obsolete entries.\nThese erroneous or obsolete entries occurred as a result of the warehouse management module using a central file on the client side in order to buffer write accesses to the database. Since it was not foreseen that several users would simultaneously execute the same client application on one and the same computer when the software was being implemented, the buffered database accesses are partially overwritten before they are transmitted to the database. Additionally, simultaneous and concurrent accesses to the file regularly cause the database client now executed on the server to crash.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.155 Lack of, or inadequate, planning of OpenLDAP", "description": "OpenLDAP is a complex application with a modular structure and, in addition, can be used with various other applications. This results in a high complexity requiring the systematic planning of the OpenLDAP use.\nA number of problems can arise from a lack of, or inadequate, planning:\n* Backends\nThe access to the database used by OpenLDAP does not take place directly via the slapd server, but is performed by one or several backends. The selection of the backend(s) and the selection of the related directives and parameters have a direct impact on the functions\nOpenLDAP is able to offer. If, for example, the back-ldif backend is used for the storage of data to avoid the installation of an additional database, only rudimentary functions of the directory service are available. Supporting a large number of users or other objects is then not possible in a useful way.\n* Overlays\nThe adaptability of OpenLDAP arises from overlays to a large extent. They control the flow of data from and to the backends and allow additional functions without the need to adapt or re-program the backends. The lack of planning of the overlay use can result in using overlays which do not or inadequately fulfil the desired function, have OpenLDAP run unnecessary operations or impair OpenLDAP in its function. For example, the required logging of access to the directory service can fail or be ineffective when the debug function of the slapd server itself and the auditlog and accesslog overlays cannot be planned correctly. Another example is the unique overlay if it is applied to internal operational parameters. Thus, OpenLDAP can enter undefined system states. If several overlays are used together (stacked), their effectiveness depends on the order in which they are called up, which is why a lack of planning might cause errors.\n* Applications\nOpenLDAP works closely together with other applications and makes functions available to them. For example, OpenLDAP can manage the user administration and address book function for email programs, Internet servers and other applications. Without other applications, OpenLDAP is not able to meet the specifications of the LDAPv3 log. Thus, a database (in general, BerkeleyDB by Oracle) is required to store the directory service objects for OpenLDAP. In addition, OpenLDAP needs utility programs for secure authentication\n(for example Cyrus-SASL) and for encrypted communication (SSL/TLS). When connected to other applications, a number of errors might arise due to the lack of, or inadequate planning. For example, incorrect versions of one or several programs whose compatibility is not given might be used. In most cases, it is also forgotten to protect the interfaces between the applications so that data can be exchanged in unencrypted form via network connections.\n* System environment\nIn the event of the lack, or inadequate planning, OpenLDAP might be run in an inadequate system environment. If, for example, a distributed file system such as NFS (Network File System) is used for the data storage of OpenLDAP, then file functions using OpenLDAP or BerkeleyDB are not available. Among other things, this applies to the locking function with which the database of the directory service can be blocked securely whilst being used in order to prevent parallel access by another user.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.156 Compatibility problems when increasing the Active Directory function level", "description": "The Active Directory or, with Windows Server 2008 and higher, the Active Directory Domain\nServices (AD DS) supports various functional levels (\"AD functional level\") for domain and overall structure (\"Forest\").\nThe functional levels correspond to the range of functions of the corresponding operating system versions and enable \"mixed\" domains, for example with Windows Server 2003 and 2008 domain controller.\nThe change to a higher functional level is made in two steps for Windows Server 2008:\n* extension of the AD scheme before inclusion of a Windows Server 2008 as domain controller (using adprep)\n* downgrading of domain functional level or forest functional level after change of all domain controllers (using domprep).\nCompatibility problems may occur with both steps, above all with the second step. Both steps cannot be reversed; rollback will not be possible. Restoring of a data backup is not recommended because all domain controllers are affected (see also S 6.108 Data backup for domain controllers).\nOften, problems only emerge during productive operation because test environments are not able to simulate the full complexity of a grown AD structure.\nCompatibility problems also often affect non-Windows systems as well as applications connected to the AD service. This may include LDAP interfaces with separate scheme extensions, e.g.\n* telephone systems, CTI or UM services,\n* Samba servers and embedded Samba servers in NAS or SAN systems, and * interfaces of Unix/Linux-based web services.\nThis may result in malfunction of the AD integration, permanently disturbing these services.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 2.157 Poor selection or conception of web applications", "description": "A web application generally uses a distributed, complex system and consists of various components (e.g. web servers, application servers, background systems) and associated interfaces. In many cases, these are integrated in an existing infrastructure, in which case the protection of the data must be ensured throughout all components and interfaces.\nIndividually developed web applications are usually designed on the basis of frameworks which provide basic functions and must be configured and/or secured according to the specific application. Frameworks, components and interfaces must be selected and their integration and protection considered, as part of the conception.\nIn contrast, during conception of web applications based on standard software (e.g. content management systems), the selection of the software and the configuration of the subcomponents must be considered, in particular. In this context, standard software means both Free/Libre Open\nSource Software (FOSS/FLOSS) and commercial software.\nRegardless of whether the web application is implemented as individual development or standard software, inadequate consideration of its complexity (e.g. of frameworks, components and interfaces) during selection and conception of web applications can put the protection of the data at risk.\nFundamentally bad decisions during the planning phase may result in vulnerabilities, which possibly cannot be eliminated at all or only through expensive subsequent improvements.\n", "examples": "Selection of web applications based on standard software\n* The application environment does not meet the minimum requirements of the web applications on the hardware and software. As a consequence, integration in the existing infrastructure (e.g. connection to a database or an identity repository) is not possible.\n* The selected product does not offer sufficient security functionality to protect data requiring protection against unauthorised access. Therefore, the necessary protection mechanisms must be added subsequently. If the product can not be extended by protection mechanisms, then the protection must be realised by external means (e.g. web application firewall). This causes additional expense.\nDesign of the software architecture of the web application\n* A security function (e.g. authentication, authorisation) is not implemented and used in one place only, but is multiply realised in the web application. If this security function is implemented differently in different places, this results in diverging security levels. Furthermore, the development and maintenance requirements increase in case of redundantly implemented functions.\n* The security function is implemented on clients only (e.g. in the web browser). If the configuration of the web browser is manipulated by an attacker, it is possible to bypass the security functions implemented on the clients. The attacker thus gains unauthorised access to data and functions requiring protection.\nIntegration and operation of the web application\n* The background systems are inadequately secured making the database of the web application accessible from the internet. An attacker can thus directly access the database and the data stored therein without using the functions of the web application. The security mechanisms of the web applications are thus bypassed and cannot prevent the unauthorised access to the stored data in background systems.\n* Application components or frameworks for session management are used in an insecure configuration. As a result, short SessionIDs with a long runtime are used. It may therefore be possible for an attacker to guess the SessionID of an authenticated user and to take over the assigned session (see T 5.169 Inadequate session management of web applications).\nExtension of the web application\n* Existing security functions of the web application are disabled due to incorrect implementation of functional extensions. If a form is added to the web application in which the input data is not validated, this can be used by an attacker for unauthorised access to the data requiring protection (e.g. during an SQL injection attack; see T 5.131 SQL injection).\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.158 Deficiencies in the development and extension of web applications", "description": "If a web application is developed or extended with non-existent or inadequate specifications and standards, then this can result in errors, loss of quality or incompletely implemented functionality.\nIn many cases, errors made in previous development phases of the application are only discovered at an advanced stage of development.

In the case of fundamental architectural errors, the development of a completely new web application is required.\nFurthermore, if there are no specifications for the implementation of security mechanisms, the protection requirements (e.g. high protection requirements regarding availability) of the data to be processed are possibly not met.\nThe following lists exemplary consequences of non-existent specifications during the development and extension of web applications.\n* Due to a non-existent procedural model for software development (Software Development Lifecycle) not all development phases are completed in a structured manner so that security aspects are not considered at all or not until a later development phase. As a result, the quality of the security function deteriorates, with the consequence that the intended security level is not achieved or the development cost increases due to the requirement of subsequent improvements.\n* Non-existent programming guidelines (Coding Guidelines) result in an inconsistent structure and different characteristics of programming styles and security mechanisms. This makes it more difficult to become familiar with the program code during extension or maintenance of the web application. Consequently, subsequent changes and extensions become very difficult to implement and, with increasing complexity, more prone to error.\n* Due to the incorrect specification of (security-related) test cases and the incomplete selection of test data not all possible applications are covered so that errors remain undetected.

In information systems without centralised logging, it is difficult to ensure that the relevant logged information of all IT systems is maintained and analysed.\nIf the users of the IT systems and applications are allowed to disable the logging function themselves, this may also cause problems. For example, a user may violate policies without this having any consequences for him/her. If the users are allowed to change or delete existing log files, there is the risk that security violations are not detected.\n", "examples": "* An unauthorised user tries to guess passwords for the web email account of other users. Since the password can often be used for other services (single sign-on), this is particularly interesting for the attacker. This attack is not detected due to a lack of logging on the email server. The attacker can guess the passwords of the users unobtrusively by using the brute-force methods.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 2.161 Loss of confidentiality and integrity regarding logged data", "description": "Some IT systems generate logged information such as user name, IP address, email address, and computer name that can be allocated to specific persons. Such information can be intercepted and manipulated if transmission is insecure and not encrypted. This risk is particularly applicable if centralised logging is used. Such information improves the attack opportunities. For example, if an attacker knows the user names, he/she can attempt to guess the corresponding passwords or try to crack the password using dictionary attacks (see also T 5.18 Systematic trying-out of passwords).\nThe integrity of the logged information may also be affected adversely by insecure and unencrypted transmission, as well as by misbehaviour of administrators. For example, if an administrator changes or deletes the logged data in order to conceal a configuration error, the information may no longer be processed further. Furthermore, transmission errors during transmission to a centralised logging server may cause a loss of integrity for logged data. However, data may also be forged deliberately in order to provide incorrect information.\n", "examples": "* By means of a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker can read the transmitted and unencrypted logged data in an unauthorised manner. Thus, he/she is provided with specific information about the information system such as the IP addresses of the individual IT systems. The attacker is now able to forge IP addresses and to masquerade as another IT system (IP spoofing). In some information systems, it is common that internal systems trust each other so that a user may log in without entering any user name or password. The attacker can now attack the target computer with the help of the forged IP address without having to authenticate.\n* Within the framework of the transmission of the log messages from the file server to the centralised logging server, physical failures in the transmission channel cause transmission errors.

If a computer becomes infected with a computer virus or a Trojan horse in this case and the user works with administrator rights, there may be wide-ranging consequences since the malware will also run with administrator rights.\nIncorrectly installing new or existing software can create security problems. It is very uncommon for standard installations of operating systems or system programs to offer all the features required for a secure configuration. Improper modifications to meet the actual security requirements can pose a considerable risk in this case. The danger of configuration errors is especially serious in complex security systems such as RACF under z/OS. Many system functions have a mutual influence on each other.\nSpecial attention must be paid to systems that, when poorly administrated, could affect the protection of other systems (e.g. routers and security gateways).\nEvery modification to the security settings and every extension of access rights constitutes a potential threat to the overall security.\n", "examples": "* When user IDs not needed any more are not deactivated, it is common for no one to take care of its privileges and contents. If an attacker is able to gain access to an unused user account, then he may be able to access internal information and applications using this account.\n* Other examples of incorrect administration are the failure to use logging capabilities or to analyse existing log files, granting access rights too generously and then failing to review the access rights at regular intervals, multiple assignment of the same login name or UID, and the failure to use the security tools available, e.g. failure to use the shadow file for passwords in Unix.\n* The effectiveness of a password decreases as it gets older. The reason for this is that the probability of a successful attack increases steadily over time.\n* In a z/OS system, the user files were protected using RACF profiles via Universal Access so that no one was able to access them unchecked (UACC = NONE). Due to carelessness on the part of the administrator, an entry in the Conditional Access List of the profile granted READ access to all IDs (* entry).

Data that has supposedly been destroyed can be read and used without authorisation in this case.\nConfidential documents are accidentally sent to the wrong recipients, and letters are printed out with internal comments and placed in the envelope without noticing the comments all the time, even when sending documents via traditional mail. Documents in which only a few pieces of confidential information need to be removed, such as people's names, are also often transferred.

In the event of a misconfiguration, the communication within a VLAN, between individual VLANs, or between all VLANs may be interrupted.

The routers must be configured correspondingly in order to allow for communication between the sub-networks, with the routers having to provide the routes between the different sub-networks in routing tables. Routing tables may be managed dynamically or statically. In both cases, communication between different sub-networks is not possible if the routing tables do not contain any route between the corresponding sub-networks. Accordingly, misconfigurations may occur due to an erroneous definition of static routing tables or due to an incorrect configuration of the routing protocols (e.g. RIP or OSPF) used for automatically synchronising dynamic routing tables.\n## Example: A router-to-router connection is configured with the help of a static entry of the corresponding IP addresses. When changing the IP address of one of the routers or by interposing another router, this communication route is no longer available.\n* Active network components capable of filtering protocols or network addresses may prevent the communication of certain protocols or prevent the communication between systems with certain network addresses using this technology. A misconfiguration of the corresponding filters may result in an undesired inhibition of the communication depending on the misconfigured filter and the type of misconfiguration.\nLikewise, misconfigured filters may cause connections to be established which offer intruders the opportunity to perform attacks against IT systems in the protected network. Depending on the type of attack, this may result in a loss of availability of individual network components or even the entire network. Moreover, data packets may be redirected and/or changed or read as a result of possibly manipulated connection routes, for example:\n* A multiport repeater is configured in such a way that only systems with certain MAC addresses can be connected to certain ports. After having replaced the network card in one of the terminal devices and the related change to the MAC address, this system will no longer be able to establish a connection to the network (loss of availability).\n* An inappropriate configuration of active network components (particularly of VLANs or filter rules) may result in broadcast domains becoming unnecessarily large or in the formation of unnecessary communication links.

This includes, for example, access rights that are specified incorrectly. When a user makes an operational mistake, not only individual settings may be incorrect, but the IT systems or applications may also be handled incorrectly. An example of this is starting programs that are not necessary to fulfil the function of the computer, but can be misused by an attacker.\nExamples of configuration or operator errors nowadays are storing passwords on a PC on which untested software is run off the Internet or loading and implementing malicious ActiveX controls.\nThese programs, which amongst others are used to make web pages more attractive using dynamic content, are run with the same permissions as those possessed by the user. They can delete, change, or send any data desired.\nMany programs intended to be used for publishing information in an open environment without restrictions can, when configured incorrectly, provide potential attackers with data that they can then misuse. In this manner, for example, the finger service can inform an attacker of how long a user has already been sitting at a computer. Browsers also transmit a substantial amount of information to the web server (e.g. the versions of the browser and operating system used, the name(s) and the Internet address of the PC) whenever a query is issued. Cookies should also be mentioned in this context. These are files on the user's computer in which the operators of web servers store data relating to the web user. This data can be called up the next time the server is visited and can be used by the operator of the server to analyse which web pages on the server the user has already visited.\nThe use of a Domain Name System (DNS) is a further source of danger. On the one hand, an incorrectly configured DNS makes it possible to query a large quantity of information relating to a local network. On the other hand, an attacker can send forged IP addresses by taking over the server, enabling the attacker to control all data traffic.\nAutomatically executable content in e-mails or HTML pages is another serious threat. This is referred to as a content security problem. Files downloaded from the internet can contain code that is executed simply by being viewed, without confirmation from the user. This is the case, for example, with macros in Office files, and this capability is exploited to create so-called macro viruses. Even programming languages and programming interfaces such as ActiveX, JavaScript or\nJava, which were developed for applications on the Internet, also have the potential to cause damage if the control function is implemented incorrectly.\nIn z/OS operating systems, the availability of the RACF security system is of primary importance to the availability of the entire system.

This can then lead to unauthorised connections and unauthorised accesses to data.\nMany VPN clients for remote access allow the data required for authentication to be stored locally after entering it the first time so that users do not need to re-enter the data every time they want to establish a connection. This, though, is a potentially serious threat if the VPN client is accessed without authorisation because the authentication mechanism will not be able to fulfil its function any more. Under certain circumstances, this could allow unauthorised persons to access local networks that are accessible from the corresponding client over a VPN connection. The security of this local network is therefore at risk.\n", "examples": "* The user account in the VPN user administration of one organisation is not deleted when an employee leaves the organisation. The former employee is therefore still able to dial in over the VPN access point and access all generally accessible data. This access could also be used to carry out serious attacks.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.41 Improper use of VPN services", "description": "Security problems can arise when using a VPN or in the environment of the VPN, for example violations of the security policies or faulty configurations related to security, due to the lack of knowledge or (usually unintentional) user errors. This risk is particularly high if the users have not been trained adequately.\nIn many cases, stationary and mobile IT systems on which VPN client software is installed are not only used to access a LAN. The Internet and e-mail are also often used over these IT systems, especially if the VPN connection was established over the Internet. In some cases, external networks are accessed, for example when field service employees open special connections to customer networks using mobile VPN clients. This can result in the following security problems:\n* Attempts to establish unauthorised connections place an unnecessary load on the system because an authorisation check needs to be performed for every connection. This then consumes system resources. In combination with faulty configurations, this can lead to successful attempts to gain unauthorised access.\n* VPN clients can be used to access the Internet, among other uses. If connections to the Internet are allowed without special security precautions, it may be possible under some circumstances to access the client computer from outside. An attacker could then attempt to disable data encryption or change the VPN configuration data so that VPN communications are not secure any more, for example. In this case, any software downloaded from the\nInternet and stored on the VPN client could contain malicious code such as viruses or Trojan horses.\n* External LANs such as customer networks or private home networks are often connected to other networks such as the Internet as well. When a VPN client then logs in to such network, uncontrolled access to the VPN client may be possible depending on the security policies of the LAN administration (see also T 5.39 Infiltrating computer systems via communication cards).\n", "examples": "* While on a business trip, an employee connected to the corporate network over the Internet. Before opening the VPN connection, he downloaded an executable file from a web server. In addition to its \"official\" functionality, the file also contained a malicious program routine that attempted to influence the security mechanisms of the VPN configuration (for example by disabling encryption). As a result, unauthorised persons can access data in the corporate network if they are able to open a VPN connection.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.42 Insecure configuration of the VPN clients for remote access", "description": "The security of a virtual private network (VPN) depends on the secure configuration of the VPN server and VPN clients as well as on the correct use of the security mechanisms offered.\nWhen the full responsibility for configuring the server is placed on the administrator, the VPN clients will often be used outside of the government agency or company, especially if the VPN is a remote access VPN. This means the clients can only be loosely integrated into the administrative procedures. Users can also be granted certain administrative rights, especially when using mobile\nVPN clients, to eliminate VPN access problems by changing the VPN configuration parameters themselves or by following instructions provided over the telephone.\nIn general, the limited control capabilities of the system administration means there is a risk that the VPN clients are configured insecurely. Examples of this include:\n* One problem is when users install unauthorised software on the VPN client, because the software may have security gaps or be infected with computer viruses or Trojan horses.\n* The settings for the VPN access security mechanisms are often left unset or are set incorrectly by the user.\nIn general, it is possible to configure (client and/or server) a virtual private network (VPN) so that only weak security mechanisms are used or no security mechanisms at all are used. The mechanisms used for data encryption when establishing connections are negotiated dynamically between the client and the server when using IPSec or SSL, for example. When negotiating, the client provides the server with a list of supported methods, referred to as the cipher suites, for selection, and the server then selects a method from this list. The list of methods that can be used can be modified by changing the configuration accordingly. There is usually an option for \"no encryption\" available as well.\nIf the ability to establish unencrypted connections is not disabled when specifying the configuration, there is a general risk that the data will not be protected during transmission. This applies especially to VPN clients on which the users have the ability to adapt the configuration of the VPN to the local conditions in case of problems.\n", "examples": "* One organisation specified that VPN communications should be secured using IPSec. The VPN server is set up so that users are queried if they want to use IPSec encryption but are not forced to use it. The VPN clients could therefore establish potentially insecure connections. One VPN user did not want to accept the loss in performance on his rather old laptop resulting from the use of encryption. For this reason, he disabled the IPSec encryption option. The VPN connection was established without the use of encryption after that.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.43 Inappropriate handling of passwords", "description": "Even the use of well-though-out authentication methods is not very helpful when the users do not handle the necessary access resources carefully. Regardless of whether passwords, PINs, or authentication tokens are used; such items are disclosed to others or stored insecurely again and again.\nUsers often give their passwords to other people for reasons of convenience. Passwords are often shared by the members of work groups to make accessing the shared files to be processed by the employees easier. Requiring the use of passwords is often considered to be a hassle and avoided by changing the passwords seldom or never or by all employees using the same password.\nIf a token-based procedure is used for user authentication (e.g. chip cards or one-time password generators), then there is a danger that the token will be used without authorisation when it is lost.\nAn unauthorised user may be able to successfully establish a remote access connection using this token under certain circumstances.\nDue to the large number of different passwords and PINs, users are often unable to remember them all. For this reason, passwords are constantly being forgotten, which sometimes results in a lot of effort to enable the user to resume working with the system. Authentication tokens can also be lost. In very secure IT systems, the loss of a password or token can even lead to the loss of all user data.\nPasswords are often written down so they are not forgotten. This is not a problem as long as they are stored carefully and protected against unauthorised access. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. A classic example is storing the password on a note under the keyboard or on an adhesive label stuck to the screen. You will also often find authentication tokens under the keyboard.\nAnother trick used so that passwords are not forgotten is to select a \"suitable\" password. If users are permitted to select the passwords themselves and are not adequately sensitised to the problems relating to this selection, trivial passwords such as \"90210\" or the names of friends are selected in many cases.\n", "examples": "* In one company, it was discovered within the framework of random checks that many passwords were poorly selected or were changed too infrequently. The users were then forced technically to change their passwords monthly, and the passwords were also required to contain numbers or special characters. It turned out that one administrator selected his passwords as follows:\nJanuary2009, February2009, March2009, ...\nThese passwords conform to the password policy, but are easy to guess.\n* In a government agency, it was discovered that users whose offices faced the street often used the same password: the name of the hotel across the street the large, illuminated letters of which dominated the view from these offices.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.44 Carelessness in handling information", "description": "It can frequently be observed that there are a number of organisational or technical security procedures available in organisations, but they are then undermined through careless handling of the specifications and the technology. A typical example of this includes the almost proverbial sticker on the monitor containing a list of all access passwords. Numerous other examples of carelessness, negligence of duty, or recklessness when handling information worthy of protection can also be found\n", "examples": "* Employees often disclose the most confidential information about their company using mobile telephones on trains or in restaurants. This information is not only heard by the person on the other end but by everyone around as well. Examples of particularly interesting internal information disclosed this way include, why the contract with another company didn't go ahead or how many millions the planning error in the strategy department cost and how that could bring down the company's stock rate if anyone found out about it.\n* Often, it is necessary to take along a notebook, an organiser, or other mobile data media on business trips. It can frequently be observed that these are left unattended in the meeting room during breaks, in the train compartment, or in the vehicle. The data stored on these mobile IT systems is often not backed up anywhere else. If the IT systems are stolen, the data is irretrievably lost. In addition, a thief may be able to profit from selling potentially sensitive information if the thief is able to easily access the information due to a lack of encryption or inadequate access protection.\n* One reason for taking along a notebook or files on business trips is to be able to make productive use of the travelling time. This practice often provides fellow travellers with interesting insights, since it is virtually impossible to prevent the person sitting next to you on a train or aeroplane from being able to read the documents or the screen.\nPublicly accessible areas, e.g. hotel foyers, hotel business centres, or train compartments, generally provide little in the way of privacy protection. If the user enters passwords or has to make changes to the configuration, an attacker could acquire this information with little effort and misuse it.\n* Articles regularly appear in the media about government agencies and companies whose paper recycling bins in the backyard contain highly sensitive documents. For example, payroll information on all the employees in one company and the private phone numbers of a company's board of directors became public knowledge in this way.\n* If IT systems are defective, they are usually sent in quickly for repair. Once a malfunction has occurred, it is usually no longer possible to delete the data stored on the IT system affected.\nWhen a failure occurs, the top priority is usually restoring the operational condition of the device as quickly as possible. For this reason, many specialised suppliers offer a special customer service by simply replacing the defective components and sending the customers back home with a working system.\nHowever, there have been a number of cases where such customer service providers were able to resolve the problem quite quickly during subsequent examination and the next customer was then given the now repaired device just as courteously - including all the data belonging to the previous customer.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.45 Inadequate checking of the identity of communication partners", "description": "Within the framework of personal conversations on the phone or via email, many people are willing to provide far more details than they would in writing or if more people were present. In so doing, the communication partner is often implicitly expected to treat the contents of the conversations or emails confidential. Furthermore, people tend to not to question the identity of the communication partner, because this is deemed impolite. This is also applicable to further questions regarding the reason for the call or the customer (\"I work for the XY bank and need some detailed information about your property relationships.\"). Such behaviours are also leveraged in the field of \"Social\nEngineering\" (see also T 5.42 Social Engineering).\n", "examples": "We know many cases where journalists called celebrities on the phone and pretended to be another celebrity. This way, they elicit statements from the celebrities that were not intended for the public. This was particularly controversial during a couple of direct broadcasts on the radio where it was not possible to undo the disclosure.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.46 Incorrect configuration of a Lotus Domino server", "description": "Misconfigurations of a software system are a frequent reason for successful attacks. Due to the complexity of a Lotus Domino server, there is also the risk that the installed Lotus Notes/Domino environment does not meet the required safety requirements due to a misconfiguration. The wealth of configuration settings and the parameters influencing each other may also entail numerous risks.\nMisconfigurations may occur both in the basic configuration of a Lotus Domino server and when configuring specific services provided by the server For example, this includes the integrated web server (HTTP-Task) or the Domino Offline Services (DOLS) used for iNotes and/or Domino Web\nAccess. However, a misconfiguration of Domino's database service constitutes a problem for the overall security of the server.\nSome typical misconfigurations are listed in the following:\n* Lack of access restrictions to a server: In the basic setting, everybody is generally allowed to access a Lotus Domino Serverl. If no access restrictions to a server are defined, this first obstacle is not used. This may cause security issues particularly in combination with weak or incorrect access authorisations to services or databases.\n* Erroneous Access Control Lists (ACLs) or insecure default ACLs : When created, each database is equipped with an Access Control List containing standard entries (defined by the respective database template). Depending on the template, this list provides for sufficient protection for the database during normal operation. This is particularly true if the database must be initialised or further configured upon creation. Often, extensive rights are required that are no longer needed for day-to-day operations. If the default Access Control Lists are not modified, this may grant unauthorised persons access to the database or grant too many rights to users.\n* No encryption is used: The encryption of the network communication (port encryption) and the encryption of databases or database fields are normally disabled by default. In order to use the encryption, it must be expressly enabled. If this is forgotten, the data is unprotected both during communication and on the data media.\n* Insufficient authorisations for servers or administrative processes : A Notes database must be administered and maintained by a dedicated server in order to work properly. Amongst other things, the administration and maintenance tasks of a server include the performance of updates of database copies (data, Access Control Lists, etc.). If the responsible server was not granted sufficient rights, the administrative actions will fail. This may cause security problems such as not being able to forward changes regarding the access authorisations to the copies of a database.\n* Cross-certificate acceptance : It is possible to enter trust settings between different certificate hierarchies (without a common certification instance) by performing a so-called cross-certification (recognition of third party certificates). If an unknown certificate is\n\"detected\", cross-certificates can be generated automatically in most cases. This is applicable both to Notes certificates and to X.509 certificates. In this way, cross-certificates could also be generated by users simply in the personal local address register. However, cross-certificates can only be generated by an authorised administrator in NAB (Notes Address Book). If certificates are thoughtlessly classified as trustworthy, this may cause security problems, e.g. regarding active contents signed with the certificate now being deemed trustworthy.\nThe issues mentioned are examples of possible risks caused by misconfigurations of a Lotus\nDomino server. Depending on the corresponding environment, further risks may occur.\n", "examples": "A server is configured in such a way that anonymous certificates are prohibited. Only SSL connections are allowed at the web interface. Therefore, no Anonymous entry is created when the\nACLs of the database are configured. Furthermore, forcing SSL-protected web access is relinquished, since the server only accepts SSL connections at the web interface. The Default rights from database templates remained unchanged in order to minimise the administrative work when the templates are changed. The introduction of a new database containing public information causes the server to be configured in such a way that normal web accesses to this database are now allowed as well (anonymous, not SSL-protected). As of now, all server databases can be accessed anonymously. In so doing, the Default rights are applicable, often at least granting a read-only authorisation. This entails the risk of unauthorised persons being enabled to read confidential data or to manipulate information.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.47 Error in the configuration of browser access to Lotus Notes", "description": "This threat was eliminated in 2013 with the 13th version of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.48 Incorrect configuration of Windows computers", "description": "Windows client and server operating systems are complex systems whose security is determined primarily by the parameter settings. This results in security risks, especially in the case of incorrectly configured components or groups of components, and these risks can result in problems ranging from malfunctions to the compromising of a Windows network.\n* When migrating from Windows NT 4.0 to a newer Windows version, the access authorizations from Windows NT, which also grant normal users wide-ranging access to system files, are retained. This means the level of access security in migrated Windows systems is generally lower than on systems in which Windows is newly installed.\n* If the NTLM authentication mechanism is configured insecurely, then it is possible to reconstruct user passwords by listening in on the network traffic. This used to be a problem especially encountered on all old NTLM versions numbered 2.0 or lower, but in the meantime, Version 2.0 of the NTLM protocol has also been compromised.\n* If the EFS is configured incorrectly (for example by using local user accounts without an active password for the syskey program), then the EFS encryption can be bypassed when an attacker has physical access to the computer.\n* Incorrect configuration of the access to removable storage access may allow users write access to removable media such as a USB stick or a CD/DVD burner, which would allow them to copy information off the information system using these media.\nIn addition to the problems arising with the operating system configuration, there are also security problems resulting from the incorrect configuration of system services such as DNS, WINS, DHCP, RAS, or IPSec. If an attacker is able to attack these components successfully, then the system security of the entire network is endangered.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.49 Incorrect configuration of Active Directory", "description": "Starting with Windows 2000 Server, the Windows server operating system has allowed individual administrative rights to be delegated to certain users, including rights to access sections of the\nActive Directory. The rights are delegated by assigning each detailed right individually in the Active Directory.\nThe following can occur due the complexity of the rights assignments in the Active Directory, for example when numerous individual rights are assigned specifically to individual object types or when authorisations are inherited:\n* Administrators can have access to areas of the Active Directory that they are not permitted to administer.\n* There can be areas of the Active Directory that are not protected by access rights, which means every user has access to this data.\nThe danger of unauthorised access due to incorrect configuration of the Active Directory access rights is even greater because, in particular, there are several access interfaces to the Active\nDirectory, e.g. Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) or Lightweight Directory Access\nProtocol (LDAP).\nIf trust relationships are set up between domains, then users in one domain will be able to access the resources in another domain. For this reason, a lack of planning of the trust relationships between the domains can lead to the granting of unintended access rights to the resources in a domain.\nOperations that change the database structure of the Active Directory are especially critical:\n* Changes to the Active Directory schema can cause the existing Windows system to be incompatible with other software packages that use Active Directory. Since some changes to the schema cannot be undone, this can mean that the existing system has to be completely reinstalled.\n* When integrating a personal attribute into the \"Global Catalog\" of the Active Directory, there is a danger that personal data could also be accessible to persons outside of the actual target group.\n* Example: In one company, the internal telephone numbers of the employees are stored in the Active Directory. If the company's computers form only one domain in the Active Directory tree of a large corporate network, then these internal telephone numbers would be distributed to every domain in the Active Directory tree when entered in the Global Catalog.\nIn order to ensure the Active Directory is configured securely even during ongoing operations, it is not only necessary to plan all security-related configuration changes carefully, but also to log the changes. If domain controllers are operated without sufficient logging, then there is a risk that unauthorised, security-related configuration changes will not be detected, and therefore will not be promptly corrected.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.50 Improper configuration of Novell eDirectory", "description": "A faulty software configuration is one of the most common reasons for the success of an attack. The high level of complexity and the large number of parameters available with eDirectory may lead to additional security problems due to overlooked side-effects.\nPossible misconfigurations may concern, amongst other things:\n* the creation and definition of the tree structure itself,\n* the configuration of the certificate server,\n* the configuration of the objects to be represented,\n* the configuration of the access mechanisms,\n* the granting of the access rights (see T 3.51 Errors in the assignment of access rights in\nNovell eDirectory),\n* the configuration of the intranet client access to the directory service (see T 3.29 Lack of, or unsuitable segmentation),\n* the LDAP access to eDirectory (see T 3.53 Errors in the configuration of LDAP access to Novell eDirectory),\n* the configuration of the partitions of the directory database,\n* the configuration of the replication of the eDirectory,\n* the configuration of the eDirectory events to be logged,\n* the configuration of the real-time alert mechanism,\n* the configuration of the iMonitor tool for web-based remote monitoring, and * the configuration of an automated backup mechanism.\nThe configuration of the system must basically be in accordance with the security policy.\nMisconfigurations entail the risk that this policy is implemented inconsistently, which means that it is impossible to achieve the objectives of the security policy.\neDirectory allows configuration of a role-based administration of the directory system and for delegating administrative rights. A misconfiguration of these functionalities may lead to significant problems due to unauthorised system accesses. Furthermore, there is a risk that proper administration will be impossible if these functionalities are configured incorrectly.\nThe following list provides an overview of the security-relevant potential consequences of a misconfiguration of Novell eDirectory:\n* selection of authentication mechanisms that are too weak,\n* incorrectly assigned rights granting access to the objects of the directory service,\n* unauthorised system accesses using the administration interface,\n* inadequate protection against attacks to the system,\n* blocking of the administration capabilities of the system,\n* erroneous or slow replication of the data between the directory databases, as well as * discrepancies in the implementation of the security policy.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.51 Errors in the assignment of access rights in Novell eDirectory", "description": "Since eDirectory contains a host of sensitive data of the system users and resources and, furthermore, there is a close relationship to the underlying operating system, the assignment of access rights to the eDirectory is of particular importance.\nThe access rights to eDirectory objects are assigned using so-called access control lists (ACLs).\nHere, there are access rights to the eDirectory object itself and access rights to individual attributes of an object.\nAt an object level, the following rights (privileges) must be assigned: browse, create, delete, rename, and supervisor. At an attribute level, these include: compare, read, add or delete self, write, supervisor, and inheritance control. Here, compare is treated as a part of the Read privilege, i.e. if the Read privilege has been assigned, is the compare privilege is automatically assigned.\nThe access control lists themselves are attributes (properties) for the respective eDirectory objects.\nThe access rights to eDirectory objects are inherited by default from parent objects to their child objects in the tree hierarchy. In order to prevent the occurrence of interruptions of the inheritance mechanism by partitioning the eDirectory directory, an inherited ACL is attached to the root object of the partition. The inheritance can be influenced with the help of so-called masks or inherited rights filters.\nThe access rights at an attribute level are not forwarded along the directory hierarchy by default.\nHowever, this may be configured using the attribute right inheritance control. This can be used to control the particularly critical self privilege as well.\nThe access rights are assigned expressly with the help of so-called trustee instructions. In doing so, the access rights (privileges) to the target object (target) are entered directly into the ACL of the target object with the help of other eDirectory objects (users, user groups, services, applications, servers, etc.).\nFurthermore, access rights may be assigned indirectly with the help of so-called security equivalences. Example: Target object X contains (at least) the same access options as target object\nY, i.e. the trustees of object Y automatically become trustees of object X. This is also configured as ACL entry of object X.\nWithin the framework of an actual eDirectory access, the so-called efficient rights are always determined, i.e. the final result of the configurations described above.\nThis variety of configuration options for the eDirectory access rights entails the risk of inconsistent or incorrect access options being assigned. If the access rights were assigned incorrectly in the eDirectory, the security of the overall system will be significantly threatened as a result. This concerns the confidentiality and the integrity of data and may open possible backdoors for wide-ranging attacks on the system.\nAnother particularly critical aspect includes the assignment of the administration rights. eDirectory allows implementation of a role-based administration concept or delegation of individual administrative tasks by assigning the corresponding access rights. If these rights are assigned incorrectly, the entire administration concept is challenged and it may also be possible that the administration of the directory system is blocked.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.52 Errors in the configuration of intranet client access to Novell eDirectory", "description": "When using the eDirectory directory service on the intranet of an organisation, corresponding clients are required for distributed user access to the system. Here, there is a separate client software for each of the different operating systems:\n* Novell client for Windows operating system,\n* client library for Linux,\n* client library for Sun Solaris.\nClient access to the eDirectory directory service is performed using the proprietary NDAP protocol (Novell Directory Access Protocol). On the one hand, this protocol is based on the Novell NCP protocol that may be operated using IP or IPX.\nWhen using the Novell client for Windows to gain access to the eDirectory tree (or an eDirectory object), the user name and the password must be transmitted to the client. Then, the client browses the eDirectory for the corresponding object and transmits the private key of this object that is encrypted with the user password. On the client side, the user password is used in order to decrypt the private key and this is used to calculate a so-called credential and a signature. The private key is then deleted from the client's memory and only the credential and the signature are maintained. These can then be used for additional \"background synchronisations\" with other objects or services. For this, the user must no longer interact and therefore uses a single sign-on.\nWith the help of a so-called zero knowledge method, the credential and the signature are used to generate a proof (proof) that is transmitted to the destination system. The destination system can use this proof to verify the client's identity. The advantage of this method is that the signature is not expressly transmitted using the network, which results in less potential points of attack.\nNevertheless, certain attack scenarios, so-called man-in-the-middle attacks, have become known, which are rather of a theoretical nature, though, since significant technical effort is required to perform such an attack.\nRegardless of this, serious security problems may occur, if\n* the authentication mechanisms for the client access are inadequate,\n* unauthorised access to the eDirectory directory and its objects is possible, or\n* administrator privileges for the directory service can be misused or obtained without authorisation.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.53 Errors in the configuration of LDAP access to Novell eDirectory", "description": "The LDAP access to the directory service of eDirectory is particularly suitable for two scenarios:\n* user access to the directory service using the internet, and * access to the directory service by additional applications.\nAs a matter of principle, there are three types of user access using LDAP from the eDirectory's point of view:\n* as [public] object ( anonymous bind ),\n* as proxy user (proxy user anonymous bind),\n* as NDS user (NDS user bind).\nHere, it must be taken into account that the [public] object has the browse right for the directory tree in eDirectory by default, unless this right has been expressly revoked.

This profile can be taken over by a colleague. Therefore, it is possible that the user account of a person is taken over without any authorisation of the system and the confidentiality of data may be affected adversely.\n* If encryption and electronic signature are used on email level, e.g. based on S/MIME or PGP, it may be possible that the private key is compromised if it is stored locally. The confidentiality of data being affected adversely and the rights being taken over by third parties are possible consequences.\n* If encryption is used on network level, e.g. by using IPSec, SSL, or TLS, this mechanism may become ineffective if the client is configured improperly.\n* Misconfiguration of the Outlook email client may furthermore result in data being lost and the client being blocked. As a further consequence, an overflow may occur, meaning that the Exchange server is overloaded.\n* If the automatic execution of dangerous file formats is restricted inappropriately in the Outlook client, viruses and other malware may penetrate the system or be distributed.\nCalendar management and the task list are further parts of the Exchange/Outlook system not directly intended for processing the email correspondence, but rather for supporting the work flows in an organisation.\nHowever, these areas may sometimes contain information as sensitive and worthy of protection as the information contained in electronic messages. Therefore, misconfiguration of these sub-systems will result in the following potential security problems:\n* loss of confidentiality due to unauthorised access,\n* loss of integrity of the information due to data manipulation (accidentally or deliberately),\n* unauthorised adoption of the role and/or identity of another user, or\n* loss of data and information due to improper data storage and a lack of backup mechanisms.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.62 Incorrect configuration of the operating system for an Apache web server", "description": "This threat was eliminated in 2011 with the 12th version of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.63 Incorrect configuration of an Apache web server", "description": "This threat was eliminated in 2011 with the 12th version of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.64 Incorrect configuration of routers and switches", "description": "The configuration of active network components strongly depends on the purpose of the devices. In the following, some examples which could threaten the secure use of the devices are listed.\nOperating system\nOutdated or insecure versions of operating systems are often used on routers and switches. Relevant websites on the internet provide exploits to be downloaded in order to attack these devices for numerous versions of operating systems of different devices and manufacturers.\nPassword protection\nAccess to active network components is often protected insufficiently by passwords.\nAdministration accesses\nAdministration accesses are often freely accessible in practice. For example, no Access Control\nLists (ACLs) have been established.\nRemote access\nActive network components normally offer a remote access option with the help of TELNET. When using TELNET, user name and password are transmitted in clear text.\nLogin banners\nLogin banners of active network components often provide information about the model and version number of the device.\nUnnecessary network services\nFrequently, routers and switches provide unnecessary network services that can be used by attackers to threaten the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of the components.\nInterfaces\nUnused interfaces on routers often are not disabled.\nVLAN\nTrunk ports may access all configured VLANs. This means that access to a trunk port will also allow access to all VLANs. Frequently, the trunking protocols on switches are not disabled on the end device ports.

There are different access options regarding the administration of routers and switches that may constitute a security risk if used improperly:\nRemote administration\nNumerous active network components offer remote administration options with the help of the\nTelnet service. However, the use of Telnet entails the risk of unauthorised obtainment of access rights, since the data traffic, including user name and password, can be read in clear text.\nMany devices provide the option of performing administrative work with the help of the HTTP service. In this case, a HTTP server is started on the router and/or switch; access is performed using any clients and the web browser. The default settings for accessing the web interface are not uniform for all manufacturers. For example, access may be disabled, but it is also possible to use this service in an unprotected manner without entering any user information.\nAs with the Telnet service, with HTTP the user name and the password are also transmitted in clear text. Moreover, a host of exploits are known which exploit weaknesses of the HTTP servers of different manufacturers.\nSNMP\nAuthentication is performed in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 using only a single plain-text community string. Almost all manufacturers set the default read community string to \"public\", while the write community string is usually set to \"private\". The SNMP community strings are transmitted in clear text in the network. SNMP is often used via insecure networks so that an attacker is able to guess SNMP community strings by reading the data packets (sniffing). After gaining knowledge of the community strings, an attacker may control the network components.\nLogging\nSecurity-relevant events on routers and switches are frequently only logged insufficiently.\nMoreover, a missing alarm component may have adverse effects on the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of the systems.\nMissing backup and documentation\nConfiguration changes on routers and switches are often not backed up or documented.

Only HFS and zFS file systems (Hierarchical File Systems) used with USS (Unix System Services) permit data to be saved in both ASCII and EBCDIC. On the exchange of data between z/OS systems and systems using ASCII code (e.g. also from USS to MVS), there is a risk that information could be corrupted if incorrect translation tables (code page translation) are used. A particularly frequent problem here is the translation of special characters.\n", "examples": "* In a company, data were transmitted between various OS/390 and z/OS systems using the FTP protocol without problems over an extended period of time. The same FTP job was used for an additional Unix system and the EBCDIC-ASCII translation performed using the default table. First, the transfer went without problems; however, on the further processing of the data records in the Unix system, it was found that, in some cases, the German umlaut and special characters had not been translated correctly. Only after the preparation of a special translation table used only for this transfer was the error eliminated.\n* On the transmission of a file using the FTP protocol from one z/OS operating system to a Unix operating system, the Binary option was used. It was not possible to further process the data on the target system, as the Binary option suppresses the conversion from EBCDIC to\nASCII.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.67 Inadequate or incorrect configuration of the z/OS operating system", "description": "The configuration of a z/OS operating system is very complex and requires considerable intervention by the system administrator. Incorrect or inadequate definitions will rapidly produce vulnerabilities that can lead to related security problems.\nAuthorised programs\nPrograms that are loaded from an authorised library and are labelled correspondingly can run functions with a high level of authorisation. If users manage to authorise their own programs without permission, nearly the same functionality is available to these programs as is available to the system programs. It is therefore possible, for example, to deactivate security barriers in RACF at any time.\nSystem programs\nWhen installing the z/OS operating system and its components, it is necessary to define certain system libraries (partitioned datasets) in such a manner that the operating system can rapidly find system programs to be run using internal tables. The libraries of these system programs are combined in so-called link lists and, as a rule, contain programs with a high level of authorisation that run in the kernel mode. Due to errors in the definition (or due to manipulation), other user libraries, which it was not intended to add, can be added to these link lists. The programs of these libraries also have a high level of authorisation and enable functions to be run that can circumvent the security mechanisms.\nErrors when creating system libraries\nSystem libraries that have been created as PDS (Partitioned Dataset) with the Secondary Space option can cause problems during operation. During the initialisation phase, the system places the directory for some system libraries in the memory for reasons of speed and only accesses the library using this directory when loading the program. If a new extent (dynamic expansion of the data area on the hard disk) is created during the expansion of a library during software program maintenance, the old program may become active instead of the new program, as the internal directory still points to the old loading address. Furthermore, as a result, the space required by a file can grow continuously without any controlled limiting.\nSupervisor calls\nSupervisor Calls (SVCs) are calls to special z/OS utilities that run with a high level of authorisation in the kernel mode. Programs for this mode must be particularly securely programmed (IBM specifies corresponding guidelines for this purpose). Under certain circumstances, insecure SVC programs can be used to circumvent z/OS security mechanisms. After a successful attack, an attacker will have a high level of authorisation in the kernel mode. Today, so-called authorisation SVCs are often still in use; they comprise a few instructions and, using modeset, switch on or off the kernel mode and therefore make it possible to run functions in the kernel mode without authorisation.\nTSO commands\nTime Sharing Option commands (TSO) normally run in the application mode (with normal user privileges), i.e. they do not have special privileges. However, z/OS has commands that need a high level of authorisation to run functions (or subfunctions). Commands that do not have the authorisation needed for processing can produce errors during operation. On the other hand, the uncontrolled enabling of authorised commands results in a weakening of the security.\nRestricted Utilities\nIBM and other software manufacturers provide additional utilities together with the operating system components. These programs run functions that perform different processing actions such as the copying of files or the creation of catalogues (z/OS file directory for managing files). The majority of these utilities only require normal user privileges to be run. However, some require a high level of system authorisation to run their functions. If these utilities are not correctly defined, there is a risk that they will not function properly. If these utilities are not adequately protected, then there is a risk that they may be misused by unauthorised employees. As a consequence, the integrity of the z/OS system may be compromised.\nz/OS commands under SDSF (System Display and Search Facility)\nSDSF enables the user to view the output from batch jobs, the system log and other system options in a JES2 system, and, in addition to this, to enter MVS and JES2 commands. If no safeguards have been taken or only inadequate safeguards have been taken, the SDSF user can manipulate the system under certain circumstances, such as terminating batch jobs, stopping or starting initiators or even re-defining system configurations. Furthermore, the user may be able to view all system messages from the syslog and also all job logs (also customer data under certain circumstances).\nEnhanced MCS support\nBeyond the MCS (Multiple Console Support) console, z/OS supports the enhanced MCS console.\nThis console represents an interface over which commands can be transferred to MVS (JES2/3) and messages can be received from MVS. The enhanced MCS console is available in TSO, NetView and applications such as CICS. If appropriate protective definitions are not made, commands can, under certain circumstances, be issued that could seriously compromise the integrity of a system.\n", "examples": "* In the past, an authorisation SVC was used on an OS/390 system to use specific functions in TSO/ISPF in the authorised mode (kernel mode). Although this vulnerability had been known for some time, the SVC was also installed in later z/OS environments and was available to every user.\n* For historical reasons, a z/OS operating system was operated with the RACF attribute OPERATIONS. Many users whose account had this attribute could read and modify almost all files. On this z/OS system, it was only possible to ensure the integrity of the data contents to a limited extent.\n* In a z/OS system, the SDSF for JES2 was made available without any protection. After only a short period of time, the employees had discovered how they could increase the priority of their own user account in the system so that they could have their batch jobs processed quicker in the system. Control and efficient utilisation of the system were no longer possible.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.68 Inadequate or incorrect configuration of the z/OS web server", "description": "Accepting the default settings or an incorrect configuration of the z/OS web server can cause security problems.\n* When using the default settings ( httpd.conf file) and incorrectly set userid rules, the web server's MVSDS function may be used under certain circumstances to display files that should normally not be available to the user, such as system files.\n* Administration errors can result in z/OS web server processes running with the started task ID. If this ID has high-level rights in the system (e.g. super user), security problems may result. File access and commands are then made and run using the authorisation of this ID. As a consequence, it is possible under certain circumstances to access files with customer data or, as described above, system files using the MVS dataset display function.\n* The z/OS web server supports encrypted data communication using the SSL log.

The rework of entire days of production can be the consequence. This applies particularly for online applications and their transaction data. Corrections are often no longer possible if, for example, customers access the system online.\n* The analysis of security incidents that takes into account time information can be made significantly more difficult or even produce incorrect results.\n* Differing system times in interconnected systems are a problem if, for example, log data are to be used for a common evaluation.\n* Applications that receive data from several individual systems and process the data as a function of the time stamp will produce corrupted results.\nSystem time on z/OS systems\nIf z/OS systems are not operated in a parallel sysplex cluster, as a rule it is necessary for the operator to enter the system time manually during the IPL (Initial Program Load).

Here RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) is often used. The configuration of RACF as supplied does not, as a rule, match the security requirements in the related operational scenario.\nThe problem areas most often found in the RACF configuration are described in the following.\nValidity rules for passwords\nUsing the SETROPTS command, it is possible to define security settings applicable across the z/OS system in RACF, in particular for passwords. The parameters include the minimum password length, the number of login attempts allowed, the maximum period of validity, the password history, audit settings and the class activations.\nMisuse of standard passwords\nAs supplied, there are standard passwords in z/OS for the ID IBMUSER and the RACF command\nRVARY. Even in operation, the system monitors with functions critical for security are often still accessible using standard passwords.\nThe ID IBMUSER is used as an initial ID for setting up a new system and has Special and\nOperations privileges. As the IBMUSER ID is not allocated to any specific user, it is almost impossible to find out who is using or has used this ID.\nUsing the RACF command RVARY, the RACF database can be activated and deactivated, i. e. also changed.\nThe standard passwords are given in the product documentation and therefore generally known.\nWarning mode\nRACF resources can be protected in the warning mode. This means that access to the resources is always granted, even though the RACF definitions would actually deny access to the resource. As a result of the warning mode, in certain circumstances considerably more messages are written to the syslog and, in addition, more SMF records (System Management Facility) generated. As a consequence the amount of disk space required can increase significantly.\nErroneously granting access to resources via the warning mode can result in a loss of data confidentiality.\nProtection of z/OS system commands\nThe z/OS system commands are protected using special classes in the RACF. If these classes are inadequately defined, it is possible for users to issue system commands that could degrade stable system operation in certain circumstances. Examples here are the starting and stopping of started tasks or placing disk systems online.\nGlobal Access Checking table\nIf files are entered in the Global Access Checking table (GAC), access is not checked using the\nRACF database. The user has direct access as per the rules defined in the GAC. If incorrect files are entered in the GAC, they will no longer be protected by the RACF profiles. These files can, e.g., be read by all users if they are entered in the GAC with READ.\nRACF databases\nThe RACF database contains, in encrypted form, all user passwords and must, like any other file in the z/OS operating system, be protected using appropriate definitions. If the access protection to the database is defined such that every user can read (and therefore also copy) the file (e.g. using the definition Universal Access(UACC) = READ), a brute force attack on the passwords is possible.\n", "examples": "* It is possible to change the RACF database using the RVARY command. A system programmer found that the password for the RVARY command was still the same as the standard password as supplied. The programmer was then able to place a different, specially prepared RACF database in the system and activate it. The programmer then had access to data that he could not view before.\n* After setting up a new RACF database, an operator forgot to disable the ID IBMUSER. A clerk discovered this carelessness and was able to copy, from the system, data to which he was not allowed to have access.\n* The backup copy of an RACF database was only protected using the definition UACC(READ) due to an administration error. An attacker utilised this error to copy the database to his PC. On the PC he used freely available programs to carry out a brute force attack on the passwords in the RACF database and was successful in several cases. The attacker then used the other users' IDs and passwords so obtained to change production data. The suspicion fell initially on the owner of the ID logged for the access to the log files, and not on the person responsible for the damage.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.73 Incorrect use of the z/OS system functions", "description": "When the z/OS system is in operation, operators need to make changes from time to time, such as customising RACF settings or other system definitions.\nDue to the complexity of the z/OS operating system and its components, it is not possible to fully exclude the possibility of incorrect actions by the operators. Depending on the nature of the incorrect action, individual components or the entire system may fail. A few typical examples of incorrect actions are given in the following.\nInadvertent restart using the Hardware Management Console (HMC)\nA system restart can be requested using the HMC. To select the system it is sufficient to simply click the system icon, then it is only necessary to select the function (e.g. Initial Program Load).\nAfter accepting a corresponding prompt, this action will result in an immediate restart of the selected system. All processes that are running will be stopped in an uncontrolled manner. As a result, a mistake selecting the system can have serious consequences.\nAs groups of systems can also be set up in the HMC, including all z/OS systems in a computer centre, large areas of information processing could be affected.\nErrors in the JES3 DSI (Dynamic System Interchange)\nThe Job Entry Subsystem JES3 permits the operation of a system group comprising a global computer and various local computers. Predominantly batch jobs are distributed across all computers in the group (global and local) under the control of the global computer and can be run (similar to a parallel sysplex cluster, but limited to JES3). The global computer takes over the central control of the entire life cycle of the batch job, such as interpretation of the job control language, system allocation, resource control, output management, etc.\nTo take over the function of the global computer on a local computer, a series of system questions must be answered. In an extreme case incorrect entries can result in an IPL (Initial Program Load) on all systems in the group.\nDisabling z/OS IDs\nIDs with the Special attribute generate a console message (reply) if the password is entered incorrectly several times during login. The operator can decide whether this ID is to be disabled. If, in an extreme case, e.g. during a DoS attack, all IDs with the Special attribute are disabled (e.g. by automatic means), there is then no longer an ID on this system that can operate the RACF. The security system is then completely locked.\nSetting disks offline\nAccidentally setting a disk offline can have serious consequences and even lead to the total failure of the system.\nDeleting the default program class in RACF\nIf the star profile for the program class is deleted accidentally (e.g. by a typing error), the system may come to a halt. An IPL will not help, as the cause of the error will not be rectified. First the\nRACF database must be corrected. Such an error can result in a system failure lasting hours and considerable effort to rectify the error.\nForwarding of incorrect RACF commands\nIf a system is included in a RACF command synchronisation (e. g. RACF Remote Sharing Facility -RRSF), an incorrect RACF command can affect all other systems in this group. If, for instance, the deletion of the Default Program Class is transmitted via RRSF, all systems in the related RRSF group may come to a halt.\nIncorrect operation of pre-defined program function keys\nThe use of pre-defined program function keys can also cause security problems in certain circumstances. Particular care is required, for example, if function keys are allocated commands that require the addition of specific values prior to execution. Here there is a risk of the operator pressing the function key accidentally without entering the supplementary information. If the related command is syntactically correct even without the supplementary information, it will be executed and may cause undesirable effects or even massive damage in certain circumstances.\nIncorrect input in general\nIn general there is always the risk of incorrect input. If, for example, a system task (or a batch job) is to be stopped and the operator makes a typing mistake, the wrong job may be stopped if job names are similar. The same applies for the use of system commands.\nIf, for example, on deactivating SNA nodes, the cross domain manager name is accidentally entered instead of a specific terminal name, all SNA sessions in this domain will be lost. After the node is restarted, the user must login again and re-establish the SNA connection to the system.\nLocking of resources\nOn mutual locking of resources (enqueue contention), functions may not be available until the lock is removed. Often a series of system prompts (displays) and considerable experience are necessary to remove the mutual locks with the aid of the right MVS commands.\nInadvertent entry of the \"Z EOD\" command\nIf the Z EOD command is entered on an MVS master console during operation, this system will be shut down in a controlled manner. All processes will be stopped and must be restarted. This action and the related system failure will last, as a rule, at least 30 minutes.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.74 Inadequate protection of the z/OS system settings against dynamic changes", "description": "Many z/OS system settings can be changed during operation without the need to perform an IPL.\nAfter an existing parameter file (member of the parmlib) has been changed or a new file added, an activation command triggers the change process.\nThe security of z/OS systems can be impaired if certain commands are used incorrectly or they are misused by unauthorised persons. The most important, critical parameter files and system commands that can be changed by dynamic settings during operation are listed in the following.\nExtension of the APF files\nFiles that must be authorised using the Authorized Program Facility (APF) can be defined in a definitions member (PROGnn) and then activated using the command SET PROG=nn (SET command and parameter PROG=m). As an alternative, individual libraries can be incorporated in the APF mechanism using the command SETPROG APF (SETPROG command and parameter\nAPF). If the parmlib definitions or the corresponding commands are not correctly protected, security problems may arise as third parties may be able to give their programs a high level of authorisation and activate them during operation.\nExtension of the LINKLIST mechanism\nPrograms that are to be available in a batch job without a Steplib or Joblib DD statement can be defined in the LINKLIST. These definitions are saved in a PROGnn member in the parmlib. Files can be added dynamically using the SETPROG LNKLST command via a member that must be defined. If the LINKLIST is defined in the system definition (IEASYSnn) using\nLNKAUTH=LNKLST, all programs loaded using this mechanism are automatically APF-authorised. The integrity of the system is also jeopardised here if the command is available without protection.\nDeactivation and modification of the user exits\nUsing the SETPROG EXIT command it is possible to deactivate exits or replace them with others. If the command is only inadequately protected, an attacker may be able to run his/her own exits on the system in certain circumstances. In this way it is possible, for example, to prevent the writing of\nSMF records (System Management Facility) and to affect the auditing of the system (covering up).\nModification of the Message Processing Facility (MPF)\nA large number of programs evaluate system messages for the automation of processes. By setting different MPF versions (Message Processing Facility) using the command T MPF=nn, automation can be disrupted or even completely disabled (T MPF=NO).\nExchange of parmlibs\nParameter files (parmlibs) are the central point for the z/OS system definitions. With the aid of the\nSETLOAD command, existing parmlibs can be replaced with new parmlibs.\nOther critical z/OS commands for dynamic changes\nAlong with the commands described above, a series of other commands for changing z/OS system settings is available, such as SETSSI for adding or deleting subsystems or SETSMS for changing the SMS definitions.\nSecurity problems can be caused by all these commands that dynamically change the z/OS definitions if they are available in the system without control. The misuse of these commands can result in problems similar to those from tampering with critical definition files.\n", "examples": "* An employee in an organisation was able to authorise his own program file due to inadequate protection of the SETPROG APF command. With the aid of a further program loaded by this file, it was possible for the employee to corrupt important financial data.\n* Using the command T MPF=NO (T is a short form for the SET command), an operator disabled the z/OS message processing. This action resulted in a console overload (message flood) and some exits defined there were disabled such that the automation of the system was seriously impeded.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.75 Inadequate control of the batch jobs in z/OS z/OS operating systems are still used to a large extent for running batch jobs. A batch job comprises one or more single steps (job steps).", "description": "The inputs to a batch job are either one/several file(s) or corresponding control cards, which are added using the Job Entry Subsystem (JES2/3). The output is also managed using the Job Entry\nSubsystem.\nThe control of the batch jobs primarily comprises starting, monitoring execution and checking the result (mostly in the form of a return code). Depending on the return code, it is often necessary to start other batch jobs. The greater the number of jobs and the complexity of executing the jobs, the greater the probability of an error is.\nManual control\nDuring the manual execution of batch jobs there is always a risk that problems will occur during the execution of the batches due to human error. Along with the sequence of execution in time, the dependencies of the batch jobs on each other are affected. With an increasing number of batch jobs to control, the complexity of the entire batch chain therefore increases drastically and will result in an ever increasing number of errors. Manual control therefore has its natural limits.\nTime delays, for example, can result in an online process running after the batch job not starting at the right time, or file backups colliding with the online process.\nComputerised control (job scheduler)\nIf a computerised process (job scheduler) is used, the execution of the jobs will be ensured.\nHowever, errors can occur if the instructions to this job scheduler have not been properly tested and there are errors in the instructions. Incorrect reactions from the job scheduler can also be caused by incorrectly defined automation during the batch processing.\n", "examples": "* The abort of a batch job during batch processing was not noticed.

This setting is often configured once when the docking station is used for the first time and is then forgotten over time. However, when data is then changed on a different end device than was originally intended, important data may be lost very quickly. This may an also be an unpleasant side effect when, for example, several users synchronise their PDAs with the same end device without considering the fact that files with the same name may be overwritten in this case.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.77 Insufficient acceptance of information security", "description": "Various circumstances can lead to a lack of acceptance of information security in an organisation or parts of an organisation, and therefore a lack of understanding of the need to impose and implement security safeguards. This could be due to any of the following reasons, for example:\n* the culture of the government agency or company (along the lines of: \"That's how it has always been!\", \"We trust our employees, so we don't have to lock anything up\", \"What can go wrong?\", or \"These security safeguards just disrupt workflows\"),\n* lack of role models, for example when a superior does not lead by setting a good example, or\n* different social environments or cultural backgrounds (\"Different countries, different customs!\"). Typical problems may arise when certain user rights or even the hardware or software allocated to a user are viewed as status symbols. Restrictions in these areas may meet enormous resistance.\n", "examples": "* In a military environment, superiors often assume that they can order their subordinates to implement security safeguards. However, experience has also shown in these cases that employees who have not been informed of the reasons and purpose of the security safeguards will bypass them when the security safeguards are simply viewed as a hindrance to their actual duties.\n* An order to only use secure passwords on a military IT system led to the implementation of a password generator. It generated random 16-character passwords that were displayed on the screen one time only for 10 seconds. This provided enough time to write the password on a note. However, since many people find it difficult to remember a password like\n\"aN\u00a73bGP?tz1BuH89\", the notes were not destroyed as ordered and were often stored in the vicinity of the computers instead.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.78 Exposed cables", "description": "In meeting, event, and training rooms, both the users and the type of use often change. This sometimes also requires changes to the equipment and therefore naturally to the cabling in such rooms. Depending on the position of the connection points in the room (outlet sockets of the power supply and the data network), this may cause cables to be routed across the room, also crossing route ways. Such \"exposed\" cables do not only constitute tripping hazards for people. If somebody trips over the cables, this may also damage IT devices.\n* In the simplest case, only the plug-and-socket connection is disconnected and the corresponding connection is interrupted.\n* However, by a sudden tug on the cable the plug-and-socket connection may also be damaged or destroyed. Furthermore, the connected device may fall from the table to the floor and be damaged as a consequence, particularly in the event of screwed connector plugs.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.79 Incorrect assignment of SAN resources", "description": "Operating systems react differently to visible storage resources. If the server and storage resource assignments are not unambiguous or strong enough, unauthorized accesses to storage resources through other servers, for example, could circumvent the security concept at the operating system or application level.\nHowever, not only deliberate attacks in which an attacker attempts to utilise loopholes in the configuration for his/her own purposes should be taken into account. It is also important to consider the particularity of some operating systems to connect to all hard disks they can access and integrate them into their own hardware configuration.\nWindows servers in particular tend to claim all visible storage resources as their own. In a storage network, this may result in storage areas assigned to other systems being removed from these systems, or in the destruction or inconsistency of the data stored in these storage areas.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.80 Errors during synchronisation of databases", "description": "Databases or excerpts of databases are often mirrored so that the data of a database can be stored at different locations or on mobile end devices. It is necessary to synchronise the database in order to be able to compare this data.\nConflicts may arise and data may be lost while performing the synchronisation if two different users have changed or deleted the same record in the mirrored databases. The rules configured in the system describing which data can be overwritten under which conditions often are not very helpful in this case, since the contents of the changed data normally need to be examined. Even when these rules apply to all synchronisations, the users may not always know the rules, which can also lead to incorrect results in some cases.\nThe synchronisation of databases installed at different locations is normally performed automatically. In such cases, conflicts are often only detected when a database administrator opens the database or analyses the log files. It is often impossible for database administrators to decide how to resolve such conflicts due to a lack of authorisations and knowledge regarding the data contents. This also holds true when the synchronisation is triggered manually, but the synchronisation programs do not provide the users with any information about the resulting conflicts.\nMobile end devices are usually synchronised manually. Some databases do offer the option of informing the users about conflicts. However, a user is not always able to make the decision regarding data synchronisation, if he does not know all circumstances of the data changes.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.81 Inappropriate use of security templates for Windows Server 2003 and higher", "description": "Windows Server 2003 and higher allows you to copy the settings in templates directly into the system configuration. There are three template types for this purpose:\n* Files with the .inf extension, called security templates in Windows Server 2003 and higher, are edited in the Security Configuration Editor (SCE).\n* XML templates, referred to as security policies in Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 and higher, are edited using the Security Configuration Wizard (SCW).\n* Files with the .pol extension (Windows NT 4.0 templates) can also be used with Windows Server 2003.\nAll types mentioned are referred to in the following as security templates. They change the system configuration as soon as they are applied.\nBesides the so-called security templates, there are also administrative templates (.adm extension).\nIn Windows Vista, the ADM files have been replaced by ADMX template files. These files use a new syntax based on XML for the registry-based policies. ADMX files offer the advantage that, in contrast to ADM files, they are language-independent and can be used with any language version in connection with language-specific ADML files.\nIn contrast to ADM files, ADMX files are no longer loaded individually into each group policy object and are instead administered in a central store. Since the Group Policy Management Console and Group Policy Object-Editor group policy snap-ins connect to the PDC Emulator by default, it is recommended in an Active Directory-based environment to place the central store for the\nADMX/ADML files in the SYSVOL directory of this operations master. The operation master roll\nPDC Emulator emulates a primary or backup domain controller in Windows NT to ensure downward compatibility.\nIt is also possible to define your own administrative templates. This approach is particularly recommended when direct registry settings are commonly used in the institution. Since it is only necessary to define an administrative template once in this case, the corresponding registry settings can be comfortably distributed via the Group Policy mechanism. Among other things, this ensures that the registry settings are actually implemented on all target computers.\nAs security templates have profound effects on the system configuration, there is the risk that certain functions or the whole server will not be available if they are not tested. If the templates are rolled out automatically on multiple servers with the help of group policies or scripts, then operational disruptions or even the complete failure of the whole information system may be the result.\nFor these reasons, improper handling of security templates leads to a high potential for risk.\nPossible threats can already be caused when creating the security templates due to incorrect handling. An analysis of the requirements is usually performed before the templates are created.\nAfterwards, a reference system is analysed manually by the administrator or automatically by the\nSCW. The analysis processes analyse numerous server components and settings that affect the operating system in a fundamental way. The analysis processes might not be complete or may fail for technical reasons without being noticed. The underlying security databases and security catalogues may be corrupt or not up to date. In addition, programmes from third-party manufacturers or special system configurations may have an unexpected influence on the analysis procedure.\nThe SCW is able to convert the security templates from the SCE and integrate them into its security policies files. This can lead to conflicts in certain parameters. In general, security templates can benefit from the distribution mechanisms of Active Directory and group policies, but to obtain full benefit, all template types must be converted to group policy objects or - in the case of .pol files from Windows NT 4.0 - be migrated. Conflicts and compatibly problems can also arise due to conversion or migration.\nInstalling security templates onto a server can fail when the server does not meet the requirements for the particular template. Older applications not developed for the current Windows versions often have unexpected side effects.\nIn addition, authorisation settings set to Refused in the template can cause unexpected responses that are difficult to eliminate.\nIn all cases described, there is a risk that a template will not have the intended effect and the system will be placed in an unknown state.\nThe risks are significantly higher when the security templates are not tested during development and roll out or the reference systems used for testing do not represent the actual systems.\nFinally, inadequate technical and organisational implementation and testing of the distribution mechanisms for security templates can place the information system at risk. If roll out operations fail without being detected, then there will be inconsistencies in the servers. Thus, the configuration does not fully correspond to the specifications so that the security objectives are not achieved either. When developing and incrementally rolling out additional templates, some target systems might not meet the expected requirements any more in this case. This situation is referred to as a situation lacking policy conformity.\nSecurity templates from Windows NT 4.0 (.pol files) are more at risk of having conformity problems and being incompatible with other template types. No tools are provided for .pol files in\nWindows Server 2003 and higher any more, and the manufacturer does not provide support any more for these files.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.82 Incorrect configuration of VoIP middleware", "description": "A VoIP-based telephone system can be affected by faulty configurations in the same manner as a circuit-switching telephone solution. Possible errors in the configuration range from incorrect telephone subscriber to telephone number assignments to a loss of the availability of the telephone infrastructure. Even rather minor errors, such as a name spelled incorrectly in the telephone book, cannot be ruled out.\nFurthermore, certain users can be granted calling privileges or have these privileges taken away on the telephone system. Examples of such privileges include the ability to call foreign countries or to call service numbers that charge a fee. An incorrect setting here can make misuse possible, for example when telephones accessible to the public are granted authorisation to make foreign calls.\nWhen using VoIP, several systems need to be integrated as a rule. If SIP is used as the initialisation protocol, then systems such as registrars, SIP proxy servers, and location servers are needed for communication. When changes need to be made, then all systems need to be adapted to the changes, possibly resulting in errors in the configurations. Even when all services are located on a single computer system, they often need to be configured individually. An incorrect change on just one system could possibly result in the inability to use the entire telephone infrastructure.\nWhen VoIP is used, a classic answering machine is generally not used, and a voice mail is sent instead when the user is absent or unavailable. The voice mail often comes in the form of an e-mail with a voice message attached in an audio file. If the e-mail address is not entered correctly in the configuration, the intended recipient will not receive the incoming messages. The messages may even be sent to the wrong recipient instead.\nIn addition to the actual VoIP telecommunication systems, the routers and switches operating in the lower network layers also need to be configured. To prevent delays in communication, many devices can be configured to assign a higher transmission priority to VoIP messages. Errors in the configuration in this case can lead (in the worst-case scenario) to the complete failure of the network.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.83 Incorrect configuration of VoIP components", "description": "Regardless of whether the VoIP components come in the form of dedicated hardware (appliances) or software-based systems, their configurations play a decisive role. In addition to the settings for signalisation, which are specified during the planning phase, the transmission method plays an important role for the media streams. By applying a compression method, the size of the IP packets containing the voice information can be reduced.\nThe use of an unsuitable method that compresses the voice information too much leads to poorer voice quality. If, however, a method that does not compress the data enough is selected, the stream of information will not be adequately reduced and the IP network can become overloaded.\nTo protect the confidentiality of the telephone calls, encryption such as SRTP can be used with a few of the media transmission protocols. To avoid the requirement that the telecommunication systems support encryption, the encryption can be performed directly between the end devices with many encrypted protocols. A faulty configuration in this case, though, can result in unencrypted transmission, possibly without the users even noticing it. If an encryption method that is too weak or key lengths that are too short are selected, an attacker will be able to listen in on the communication under certain circumstances in spite of encryption.\nNot only the ability to eavesdrop on conversations is of interest to an attacker. The information transmitted during signalisation can also be misused by an attacker. If the password is transmitted as plain text when a user logs in due to an incorrect setting on the end device, the attacker might be able to assume the identity of another user, for example, even though all VoIP components involved support secure (challenge-response) methods. By stealing this identity, the attacker could make telephone calls at the cost of the victim or misuse other services, such as the ability to listen in to the messages on the answering machine.\nIn many cases, applications such as softphones or software-based telephone systems are operated on a standard PC. For this purpose, a commercial operating system must be installed on the PC to execute the corresponding programs. Errors in the administration and configuration of the operating system can have a major effect on the operation and security of the VoIP applications.\nRegardless of whether an end device (softphone) or a telecommunication system (software PBX system) is operated on the IT system, the improper distribution of access rights can lead to certain functionalities not being used on the one hand, or to the misuse of any access rights granted incorrectly on the other.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.84 Incorrect configuration of the WLAN infrastructure", "description": "Access points and other WLAN components offer a number of configuration settings that also affect the use of security functions in particular. If the wrong settings are specified on such components, then it may be impossible to communicate over the access point, or communication may be carried out without sufficient protection even though the user assumes protection has been provided. The faulty configuration of WLAN components can cause various security problems, for example:\n* If an access point is not adequately protected against unauthorised access, then someone may be able to make changes to its configuration, which then open additional security gaps.\n* Availability problems or security gaps can arise due to non-uniform configuration of the WLAN security mechanisms on the access points.\n* If the Internet can be accessed over a WLAN, then anyone who can connect to the WLAN can also use the Internet without using any additional filter mechanisms.\n* Granting permissions for shared directories or other system resources too generously on a WLAN client can permit an attacker to access the client without being noticed.\n* If the personal firewall of a WLAN client is not correctly configured or has been disabled by the user, then the client may be subject to attacks at the operating system level under certain circumstances. This is especially a problem in external environments and hotspots.\nRemote support accesses to WLANs always cause security problems when these accesses are not adequately secured and are used over insecure networks. If the configuration is incorrect in this case, then this can lead to the compromising of a WLAN client, for example, and an attacker could then gain information on how to access the WLAN. This information can then be used to attack the entire WLAN and possibly any LAN connected to the WLAN.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.85 Impairment of fire protection compartmentalisations", "description": "Numerous cables and lines are routed through buildings housing IT operations.

Extra cables also change the fire load of a cable tray. The result is that the function of fire protection constructions may be significantly impaired while such work is being performed and afterwards as well.\nUnfortunately, experience has shown that the persons entrusted to do this type of work (the planning, execution, and approval of the work) often misjudge the consequences of their actions for the fire protection, and act accordingly:\n* Alternative measures to compensate for the fire protection removed are neither planned nor implemented.\n* Damaged fire seals are not repaired immediately or not repaired properly.\n* Fire protection measures are not adapted to the new situation.\nThe result of these human errors is a higher risk of ignition of a fire and a higher risk of spreading smoke and fire.

This information may include development results, strategy documents, or other confidential information. The reproduction of such documents is usually controlled so that this information cannot be disclosed to unauthorised persons.\nWhile striving for the highest possible level of security for all information processed by IT systems, the security of the information in physical form must not be neglected. This includes, for example, printouts, paper files, or microfilms. The strongest encryption is useless when the encrypted document is printed out after decryption and can be viewed by unauthorised persons.\nWhen network printers are used, the printed documents are often left for long periods of time in the output tray of the printer. Users will often print out several files before picking them all up together, especially if the printer is not located in the immediate environment of the users. Since floor or department printers are used by a large number of people, there are also many people who are able to read or take the printouts.\nWhen printouts are not picked up immediately, the probability that they will be read or disappear entirely increases. This may not even be intentional. If an employee who also wants to use the printer needs to wait for their printout for a long time, they may pass their time waiting by looking at the documents printed out by other co-workers but which have not been picked up yet.\nThere are often also confidential documents near or in the copier, for example because they were forgotten in the copier.\nUsers often do not look for the cause when they cannot find their printouts in the printer. They will usually assume it was an IT problem and start a new print job since they are used to hardware and software problems occurring and causing inexplicable phenomena. The printouts may have been taken by someone else, though. It is also often the case that a user will accidentally select a different printer on their workstation computer than the printer they usually use. The user will then look for their printouts on the wrong printer. They will not find them there and simply start a new print job, this time on the standard printer. For this reason, you will often find printouts that were not picked up on many network printers.\n", "examples": "* A user notices they printed out the wrong document in the printer room and disposes of the misprint directly in the waste paper bin provided there.

In the case of directory services, the high level of complexity and the large number of parameters available can lead to additional security problems due to overlooked side-effects. Faulty configurations can have a particularly serious impact in the following areas:\n* certificate server,\n* creation and definition of the tree structure itself,\n* configuration of the objects to be represented,\n* access mechanisms,\n* assignment of access rights,\n* LDAP access to the directory service,\n* partitioning of the directory database,\n* replication of the directory service,\n* intranet client access to the directory service,\n* real-time alert mechanism,\n* specification of the events to be recorded,\n* data access rights of the administrator tool,\n* configuration of an automatic backup mechanism.\nIn general, the configuration of a system needs to be based on its security policy. If there is a faulty configuration, then there is a risk that the security policy will be implemented inadequately or incorrectly, which means it will be impossible to achieve the objectives of the security policy.\nThe configuration of a role-based administration for the directory system as well as a delegation of administration rights are generally primary features of a directory service. Incorrect configuration of these features can, under certain circumstances, lead to significant problems due to unauthorised system access. Furthermore, there is a risk that proper administration will be impossible if this feature is configured incorrectly.\nThe following list shows possible security-related consequences resulting from an incorrect configuration of the directory service:\n* incorrectly assigned rights granting access to the objects of the directory service,\n* selection of cryptographic authentication mechanisms that are too weak,\n* unauthorised system accesses over the administration interfaces,\n* blocking of the administration capabilities of the system,\n* inadequate protection against attacks to the system,\n* incorrect or low-performance storage of the data in multiple directory databases (replication) as well as\n* discrepancies in the implementation of the security policy.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.88 Errors in the assignment of access rights", "description": "Due to the close relationship between the directory service and the underlying operating system and the fact that directory services contain a series of critical data on the users of the system and on the resources, the correct assignment of data access rights to the directory service is particularly critical to security.\nThe access control lists themselves are attributes (properties) for the corresponding objects. Access rights to the objects themselves are available, as well as rights to access individual attributes of an object. The access rights to objects are inherited by default from parent objects to their child objects in the tree hierarchy. Unsuitable partitioning of the directory in this case can break this inheritance mechanism.\nThere is also a risk of assigning the access rights inconsistently or assigning the wrong access rights due to the variety of configuration options. If the access rights were assigned incorrectly in the directory service, then the security of the overall system will be significantly threatened as a result. This could have an impact on the confidentiality and the integrity of data and open possible back doors for wide-ranging attacks on the system, for example.\nAnother particularly critical point is the assignment of the administration rights, for example the implementation of a role-based administration concept or the delegation of individual administration tasks by assigning the corresponding access rights. If these rights are assigned incorrectly, then the entire administration concept could be in question, and under certain circumstances, the directory system administration may even become blocked.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.89 Errors in the configuration of LDAP access to directory services", "description": "LDAP is particularly suited for use as a protocol for accessing directory services when the directory services are accessed using other applications, for example Internet or intranet applications. However, the following problems can arise if access to LDAP is configured incorrectly:\n* Incorrect assignment of access rights and the ability to access the directory service without authorisation\nUsing directory services from different manufacturers can result in problems with the LDAP settings that are based on extensions of a particular directory service, for example Active Directory or Novell eDirectory. Furthermore, it is possible to assign users the wrong rights due to the use of incompatible LDAP syntaxes. As a result of this, it may be possible for users to unintentionally access areas that they actually should not have any right to access.\n* Transmission of user passwords as plain text and spying on unencrypted information\nSince LDAP is a purely text-based protocol, all information, even including user passwords, are transmitted as plain text and could be spied on during transmission. For this reason, LDAP should be provided with additional protection, for example using SSL encryption. However, there are many ways to incorrectly configure SSL encryption, and they can all result in a lower level of security.\n* Errors in LDAP accesses, especially for network-based applications\nIn this case, attempts to log in may fail occasionally even though the correct authentication information was used. This could be caused by differences in the LDAP configurations of the individual components of the directory service, for instance.\n* Impaired availability of the directory service due to the LDAP encryption settings\nThe availability of large portions of the directory service can be severely impaired by faulty configurations, executing procedures incorrectly, and activating the signature and encryption settings for LDAP in the wrong order. In large environments, it may be very difficult to restore the directory service to an operable state since many network-based administration and control functions are disrupted in such situations. The impact of such inconsistent settings may only be noticed after a certain period of time under some circumstances.\n* Inadequate productivity of the overall system due to the use of different LDAP versions\nIf the clients support different LDAP versions, then there may be different configuration options available under certain circumstances. If clients use an older version of LDAP, for example, the older version may not support new command sets or there may still be vulnerabilities in the functions provided, etc. Even when the clients do support the different LDAP versions, the associated configuration options resulting from this support can lead to errors that have a negative impact on the security of operations.\n* Search filters that are not restricted or restricted insufficiently\nIf a directory service is used as public address or certificate server via LDAP, search queries made via the Internet are responded to by the directory service. For example, the corresponding certificate for a possible encryption is transmitted after an e-mail address has been entered. If the search and return criteria are not restricted, internal information may be disclosed to the outside world via these queries. If, for example, a company allows the use of placeholders (so-called wild cards) for searches and does not restrict the output for the response either, the entire directory can be read with just a single query. Searching for the certificate related to the *@* address would then result in a complete list of all e-mail addresses of the organisation's employees as output. This list can be used to send spam or to prepare targeted attacks (see T 5.42 Social Engineering).\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.90 Incorrect administration of VPNs", "description": "The incorrect administration of a VPN end point can threaten the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of the networks involved. This therefore poses a potential risk to secure operations that cannot be overlooked.\nThe following aspects must be taken into account for VPNs, among others:\n* Routine security-related tasks are often neglected on a VPN client. Such tasks include, for example, regularly backing up the data or scanning for computer viruses. Mobile VPN clients in particular are usually taken along by their users and are therefore difficult to access for the purpose of system administration. It is possible to administer the client remotely over an open VPN connection, but the connection times may be too short (depending on the usage profile) to perform remote maintenance properly. If the administrative tasks are not performed regularly, then the result could be unmatched configurations.\n* Computers can be administered remotely with the help of common software products and this is frequently possible to a certain extent using the mechanisms of the operating system. The use of unauthorised software (by the user or the administrator) can result in the use of unauthorised protocols over a VPN-connection or in new security gaps due to insecure settings.\n* Encrypted data cannot be scanned by computer virus protection programs. If the concepts for encryption of the data and protection against malicious code are not co-ordinated, then there is a high risk of computer viruses, Trojan horses, or worms, for example, being introduced through the VPN client and causing damage in the network.\n* Since VPN clients are operated in many cases in insecure environments and it is therefore practically impossible to control the exchange of data media, for example, then computer viruses and other malicious code pose a particularly high threat. If there is no up-to-date computer virus protection program installed on the VPN client, then the risk of introducing computer viruses, Trojan horses, or worms into the LAN over the VPN client is especially high.\n* If bandwidth-intensive functions are executed over VPN connections, then there is a risk of a user cancelling the VPN connection and establishing a new one because the user assumes that a malfunction has occurred. In most cases, the real reason is that the response time is unacceptably long because there is not enough bandwidth available. On the one hand, this can result in inconsistencies in the application data, and on the other hand, to an increase in the load placed on the VPN.\n* Since VPNs become highly complex once they reach a certain size and structure, errors in the configuration can lead to insecure and incorrect settings. This risk is especially high when the administrators have not been adequately trained in the technologies and products used. In this case, errors in the configurations can range from missing security settings to incompatible communication protocols. The consequences resulting from these errors vary greatly as well. One consequence could be that it is impossible to open the connections required or that third parties will be able to connect successfully to the VPN gateway without authorisation.\nEvery modification to the security settings by untrained administrators and any extensions of the access rights (see T 3.16 Incorrect administration of site and data access rights) can impair the overall security. The configuration changes made on VPN end points are often neither secured nor documented. If the components subsequently fail, then it will be impossible to determine the last changes made, which is required to successfully restart the system. Even a poor operating concept or inadequately planned maintenance windows can have a negative impact on the availability of the\nVPN.\n", "examples": "* A new administrator who had not been trained yet changed a configuration parameter of the VPN without giving it much thought. This resulted in a long-term interruption of the connection shared by a manufacturer and its supplier. This then led to a costly shutdown in production because urgently needed parts could not be delivered.\n* One company used a software management system that regularly installed new software updates on every user's computer. Due to a configuration error, the mobile VPN clients were also included in this procedure. After successfully establishing a connection, the entire bandwidth was consumed by the management software to transfer a large update package to the mobile clients.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.91 Failure of the VPN connections due to operating errors", "description": "In addition to technical failures due to defective components or power failures, for example, there is also a series of additional circumstances that can lead to the failure of a VPN connection.

The main cause of failures due to incorrect operation is inadequate training of the parties involved. Administrators are not the only cause of problems. In many cases, incorrect operation by users will result in overloads or to a failure of the VPN services.\n", "examples": "* One company with several branch offices at different locations used a VPN to connect the branch offices with each other. An update of the software used on all VPN components to a more recent version that was incompatible with the previous versions required the reconfiguration of every VPN system.

This makes launching an attack easier, because the NTLM protocol is not as robust as the NTLMv2 protocol in terms of security.\nExample 2:\nBy default, a Samba server does not use SMB Message Signing (server signing parameter in smb.conf). The SMB protocol is therefore susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\nExample 3:\nIf Samba uses the ldapsam application as a backend when it is used as the Primary Domain\nController (PDC), then the account information of each user (for example the LAN Manager (LM) and/or NTLM hashes) are stored in a LDAP directory.\nIf the connection between Samba and the LDAP server is not encrypted using the Secure Sockets\nLayer (SSL), then an attacker can obtain the password hashes of the users by listening in on the connection and then calculate the passwords with little effort under some circumstances.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.95 Incorrect configuration of the operating system of a Samba server", "description": "An incorrect operating system configuration of a Samba server can disrupt the secure and error-free operation of the server or aggravate the effects of malfunctions.

For example, if file folders are moved from a Windows system to a Samba file share, then all access control list (ACL) entries that cannot be implemented using the standard file system authorisations available in Unix will be lost.\n* Incorrect configuration of the local packet filter.\nThe Samba service listens in on various TCP and UDP ports so it can establish network connections with the clients.

Further partitions on internal hard drives such as a data partition can only be encrypted using BDE under Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and higher. Under Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 and higher, BDE includes the function BitLocker To Go for encryption of external and virtual data carriers.\nA user of Windows Vista without Service Pack 1 can incorrectly assume that BDE encrypts all data on a hard drive, including the data in an additional data partition. This can lead to violations of the confidentiality of user data if this data, in contrast to the assumption of the user, is not stored in encrypted state.\nBDE is completely transparent to the users when running on a Windows Vista system. During the start-up procedure, BDE decrypts the partitions after entry of the correct access data or the biometric ID. These will remain unencrypted during the whole runtime of the IT system. During this time, BDE provides no protection for the confidentiality of the data. Correspondingly, BDE particularly does not offer protection against violation of confidentiality by malicious code.\nAdministrative authorisation is required for BDE configuration of local hard disks. For mobile and virtual data carriers, normal user authorisations are sufficient. If a user or malicious program possesses administrative authorisation or user rights, then the privileges can be used to deactivate\nBDE without authorisation, to add additional keys of his own making, or to delete key material.\nThe effect of deactivation or unauthorised addition of a key created by the user himself is the loss of the confidentiality of the data. The deletion of the system partition's key material leads to the loss of the availability of the overall system.\nThe deactivation of BDE or the undesired deletion of key material, when the user or program possesses administrative authorisations, can also result in the incorrect operation of the manage-bde.wsf or manage-bde.exe maintenance tool supplied with the system.\nThere is also a danger of a violation of confidentiality in spite of using BitLocker Drive Encryption when unauthorised persons obtain knowledge of the recovery key. The recovery key can be used to decrypt a partition encrypted by BDE. This is true even when using a Trusted Platform Module\n(TPM) because the recovery key is intended to permit decryption, especially in the case of a defective TPM.\nFor maintenance, the BDE configuration tools allow for temporary disabling of hard drive partition encryption without encrypting data. The data will remain encrypted, but an open start key (Clear Key) is stored unprotected on the drive. The integrity checking during start-up procedure is also deactivated. In this state, the system - also on other hardware - can be started without authentication, and enables unhindered data access. It can be copied, and the Clear Key can be read.

For this purpose, it usually makes an emulated network card available to the virtual IT systems. This in turn allows the virtual IT systems to access networks or storage networks. These (storage) networks can be either physical or virtual networks.\nTo be able to use virtual IT systems, the virtualisation server must allow a connection between the virtual network components of the virtual IT systems and the physical networks. This is accomplished by the virtualisation server making its physical interfaces available to the virtual IT systems. The procedure varies between the different virtualisation products. However, there are two key principles to carrying out the transition from virtual to physical network components:\n* By means of direct assignment of virtual to physical networks: The network card of a virtual IT system is directly assigned to a physical interface of the virtualisation server.\n* By means of indirect assignment: The (virtual) network cards of the virtual IT systems are connected to a virtual switch. This is represented by the virtualisation server in the software. The virtual switch in turn may be connected to the physical network using a physical network card. Since a virtual switch does not necessarily have to have a physical network transition, a network can be realised in this manner; in this network, the virtual IT systems connected to it do not have any connection to the outside. Such a configuration can be used, for example, for test systems that do not need external connections.\nWithin the administration software of the virtualisation server, the network interfaces of the virtual\nIT systems are assigned to the physical interfaces of the virtualisation server. If this assignment is not carried out correctly, a virtual machine might be connected to a wrong network. If, for instance, an Intranet web server with confidential data which is to be operated only in the internal network is thus connected accidentally to the Internet, bypassing the security gateway (firewall), the confidential data might be visible in the Internet.\nCompared to other servers, a virtualisation server is often equipped with a large number of network cards. This large number is necessary to achieve the best possible integration of the virtualisation server into the network of the computer centre. It is thus possible to operate virtual IT systems required in different network segments on a single virtualisation server. In addition, other interfaces are required for different functions of the virtualisation servers, for example, to access the storage networks or the Live Migration allowing a running virtual IT system to be moved from one virtualisation server to another.\nBecause of the large number of network cards and connection of cables to switches and similar IT systems that is untypical for a server, there is an increased risk of unintentionally generating errors in the network infrastructure due to incorrect cabling. In addition to the errors listed in T 3.4\nUnauthorised connection of cables and T 3.29 Lack of, or unsuitable segmentation, examples of such errors include the following:\n* Using two physical network cards of the virtualisation server and a virtual switch, the coupling of two network segments is switched by mistake (bridge). These networks, however, should not be connected to each other. Connections between these networks should only be made possible by a security gateway. Because of the incorrect cabling, it is now possible to establish direct connections between systems. The actually desired segmentation of the network is suspended unintentionally.\n* Two physical network cards of a virtualisation server are assigned to a virtual switch. They are connected accidentally to two different physical network segments. The virtual switch is configured in such a manner that it does not transmit the packets received on the one network interface to the other interface and thus does not establish a bridge (see above). Due to the two network interfaces connected to different network segments, the virtual switch is not clearly assigned to a physical segment. Due to this error, the load distribution mechanism of the virtual switches has the effect that the network packets of a virtual IT system connected to this switch are transmitted sometimes to the one, sometimes to the other network segment. Thus, the virtual IT system can only be reached sporadically within the network and the availability of the system is at risk.\n* Several virtualisation products can detect incorrect cabling (as described in the previous two cases) and switch off one or several physical network cards in such a case. In this case, it might no longer be possible to predict which physical network segment the virtual switch is actually connected to. This can result in disconnections to the IT systems connected to the affected virtual switch.\n* Using two or several virtualisation servers, a virtual infrastructure is set up. For this purpose, these severs are to be connected with several physical network segments which are assigned to virtual switches respectively. These switches are named correspondingly with the respective physical segment (switch A - segment A, switch B - segment B etc.). Due to a cabling error, the physical segment A is now connected to the virtual switch B on one of the two virtualisation servers. If the Live Migration function is now used in this virtual infrastructure, the migration process causes a virtual IT system on switch B to be located in a different physical network segment following the migration than it was before the migration. The reason for this is that switch B is connected to segment B on one virtualisation server, but is connected to segment A on the other virtualisation server. The availability of the system is thus at risk. There is also the risk that access to data provided by this system is possible in networks in which this access is actually not permitted.\n* For the operation of the virtual IT systems, virtualisation servers often need connections to storage networks in which the data (configuration files, file containers of virtual hard disks) are stored. If the connections to these storage networks are cabled incorrectly, malfunctions can occur when the virtualisation servers access the storage network. This is a threat to the availability of the virtual IT systems operated on these virtualisation servers. This may affect a large number of virtual IT systems.\n* Errors in the cabling of network cards used by the virtualisation servers to communicate with each other in a virtual infrastructure also have extensive consequences for their function. Thus, the Live Migration and Fault Tolerance functions are based on the synchronisation of a copy of a virtual IT system on two different virtualisation servers. Fault Tolerance is a procedure that is used to operate a virtual IT system on two virtualisation servers at the same time, with only one copy being active and the other passive. If one of the virtualisation servers fails, the copy of the virtual IT system based on the server still running transparently takes over all functions of the failed server. If the network connections using the virtualisation servers to synchronise virtual IT systems for Live Migration or Fault Tolerance are now cabled incorrectly, it is possible that these virtualisation functions do not function properly. As a result of this, the availability of the virtual IT systems is at risk.\nNetwork connections for virtualisation servers\nThe network connections of the virtualisation servers are often designed redundantly, as a large number of functions of the virtual infrastructure depend on the physical interfaces. In order to increase the availability of network interfaces, several network cards are usually configured in such a manner that they can execute the function of the respectively other card alternately or even simultaneously. There are different procedures for this purpose:\n* Load balancing: The MAC addresses of the virtual IT systems are distributed to the physical interfaces based on an algorithm in order to achieve as even a distribution of the load of the individual physical interfaces as possible. If one of the interfaces fails, one of the remaining interfaces takes over the task of the failed interface. Here, the network connection of the virtual IT systems is, at the very most, interrupted imperceptibly. This procedure is compatible with all common physical switches and usually does not require a special configuration of these switches. Load balancing is not specific to virtualisation, but the procedure is of particular importance for the use of virtual IT systems.\n* IEEE 802.3ad (Link Aggregation Control Protocol - LACP) or Etherchannel (Cisco) are protocols in which several physical interfaces are integrated into one logical channel. These procedures usually require an adapted configuration on the connected physical switch.\nMoreover, there is a number of manufacturer-specific designations for different protocols and procedures used to increase the availability of network cards, for example Bonding in the Linux environment, Teaming, Port Aggregation, Link Aggregation and Trunking. Here, some protocols require that configurations adapted correspondingly be carried out on the physical switches. The procedures are sometimes only compatible to a limited extent. If these procedures are mixed in an inadmissible manner or if there are misunderstandings between the administrators of the virtualisation servers and those of the physical network infrastructure systems, incompatibilities can arise due to malfunctions. In many cases, the disconnections resulting from this only occur sporadically and it is accordingly difficult to establish their causes.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.100 Improper use of snapshots of virtual IT systems", "description": "Using snapshots, the state of a virtual machine can be frozen at any time. In this respect, it is not important whether the system is running or not in the moment the snapshot is created. In this manner, it is possible to easily access the state of the virtual IT system preserved in the snapshot.\nThe snapshot can also be transferred to another virtualisation server or be used as data backup.\nIf the virtual machine is still operated after a snapshot has been created and the preserved state is loaded afterwards, all changes made to the guest system since that time are lost. When proceeding without due care, this might cause losses of data and is often undesirable for productive systems.\nChanges to the operating system, services and applications of the virtual IT system can also be reset in this manner. Insufficient file authorisations, security gaps and vulnerabilities or even deleted user accounts thus become active again.\nFor virtual servers which have open files or database sessions, this might result in inconsistent data. This is the case for instance, when information is being written by a client to the virtualised server whilst the snapshot is created. The file content to be saved is then not included completely in the snapshot. If the frozen state of the virtual machine is now used again, it is highly probable that there are defective files or databases with impaired integrity.\nDistributed systems such as database clusters or also Active Directory domain controllers usually use a replication mechanism to ensure that their data is synchronised. Here, significant problems might occur when they are set to a snapshot. In such a case, inconsistencies might arise in the databases, which cannot be resolved by means of the replication mechanism.\nIf there is not sufficient disk space for comprehensive or several snapshots available, it might happen that there are bottlenecks regarding the disk space and it is not possible to save other information.\n", "examples": "A large photo laboratory develops films for its customers. For this purpose, the customers send in their films in an envelope and provide their return addresses on this envelope. All envelopes are labelled with a unique number. In the laboratory, the films are additionally assigned an internal reference number. This internal reference number is used to make the films anonymous. For the automated shipping procedure, the reference number is stored together with the machine-readable envelope number in a database. When the photos have been developed, they are automatically assigned to the envelope based on the reference numbers. The envelope is then returned to the customer by mail.\nThe management of the photo laboratory has now decided to virtualise not only other IT systems, but also the database system ensuring the assignability of the reference and envelope numbers.\nDuring the production in the laboratory, the administrator responsible detects a problem on the virtual database server. In order to eliminate this problem quickly, he resets the server to a snapshot. He knows that the server functioned properly at the time at which the snapshot was created. However, the assignment of reference and envelope numbers is now no longer correct, since the table with the assignment of the reference numbers to the envelope numbers is also reset to the snapshot. The error remains unnoticed in the shipping department. As a consequence, several customers are sent the wrong films. A large number of films can no longer be assigned to the customers, which causes a loss of reputation of the photo laboratory resulting in significant losses in sales.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.101 Improper use of guest tools in virtual IT systems", "description": "For many virtualisation products, so-called guest tools can be installed in the virtual IT systems. On the one hand, these guest tools can be used to provide the device drivers required for operating system virtualisation for virtual or emulated devices such as network cards, hard disks or graphics cards. On the other, they provide a number of functions for virtual machines. Such functions are for instance:\n* shutting down the operating system of a virtual IT system without interaction in the virtual IT system via the virtualisation server directly,\n* exchanging the content of the clipboard between the console emulation of the virtual machine and the workplace system of the user,\n* seamless integration of the mouse cursor of the user's workplace system in a virtual machine with its console emulation,\n* simplified loading and unloading of data media in the virtual IT systems. This can be physical floppy disk, CD or DVD drives, but also image files of such data media (ISO images).\nThese functions increase the user-friendliness of the virtual IT systems and, in addition, allow an automated management of the operating states (switching on/off, booting and shutting down) of virtual IT systems by the virtualisation server.\nShutting down the system without logging in/interaction\nIf the function for shutting down an IT system is used by an administrator of the virtualisation server, more restrictive configuration settings, if any, within the virtual IT system itself are circumvented or policies violated, which prohibit restarts or shutdowns without proper authorisation.\nAccess to CD/DVD drives or floppy disk drives\nWith the corresponding configuration, the guest tools also allow direct access to the drives of the virtualisation server. For example, access to the physical CD drive connected in the virtualisation server, might be thus possible from a virtual IT-System. A CD-ROM with confidential data which was inserted in the drive of the virtualisation server to transfer the data contained on the CD-ROM to a certain virtual IT system can thus also be accessed from other virtual instances. The confidentiality of the data is threatened, as data was possibly read by unauthorised persons.\nFor some virtualisation products, it is also possible to open the CD or DVD drive compartment of the virtualisation server from a virtual IT system using the guest tools, when they are configured accordingly. The drive could be damaged, if, for example, it hits the door of the server cabinet or is stopped by a decorative screen at the server housing.\n", "examples": "* In a medium-sized company, several virtualisation servers are used. On these severs, several virtual IT systems are operated. Some of them belong to an ERP system on which all commercial applications of the company are operated. This ERP system is not managed by the same administrators as the virtualisation servers. As high protection requirements were determined for the servers belonging to the ERP system, these systems may only be shut down when a maintenance period has been agreed upon with the users of the ERP system. In addition, the servers may only be shut down by specifically authorised administrators, and this must also be logged and documented by the respective administrator. To implement this policy technically, the authorisation to stop the individual ERP systems was only granted to the ERP administrators in the operating system of the virtual IT systems. Moreover, the operating system was configured in such a manner that it forces the administrator to give reasons before shutting down the system.\nIn one of the virtualisation servers, a fan fails. This is not directly critical for the functioning of the server, but the defective fan should still be replaced immediately. For this purpose, the administrator of the virtualisation server arranges an appointment for the repair with a service technician of the server manufacturer. On the following day, the technician of the manufacturer shows up in the morning. He has the required spare part with him and would like to start immediately with the repair, because he also has other appointments. In order to replace the fan, the virtualisation server must be switched off. The administrator of the virtualisation server now shuts down the virtualisation server using the administration console. In the process, all virtual IT systems are also automatically shut down using the guest tools. The guest tools shut down the systems without the required logging and do not check either whether the administrator has been authorised at all to do this. After the repair has been carried out, the administrator switches on the virtualisation server and boots all virtual IT systems again.\nDuring the repair, important parts of the ERP system are not available, resulting in a high loss of working time as several employees cannot carry out their tasks. The administrators of the ERP system are reprimanded by the management of the company, because they have disregarded the policies and have not ensured that the ERP systems can only be shut down by authorised administrators. Furthermore, logging regulations were ignored.\n* The administrator of a virtual IT system is bored and explores the functions of the guest tools installed on the virtual IT system. In doing so, he finds the function for connecting and separating physical CD or DVD drives of the virtualisation server. Since he does not know that opening the drive compartment in the virtual IT system actually results in opening the physical drive compartment of the virtualisation server, he fiddles around with the corresponding function.\nA technician who is in the server room at this time and carrying out work on an IT system next to the virtualisation server does not notice the open drive and the sleeve of his shirt gets caught on the drive tray. Thus, the drive is damaged and must be replaced.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.102 Improper time synchronisation on virtual IT systems", "description": "Commonly used operating systems have their own internal clock. Here, the time is usually determined by the operating system by counting the processor cycles and by means of the occasional comparison with a reliable time source such as a time server or an internal hardware clock. The time and frequency of the synchronisation with the time source depends on the operating system used.\nGuest operating systems in virtual environments, however, do not have any control over or knowledge of the actually consumed processor capacity on the physical IT system. The calculation of the current time using the processed steps of calculation as time base is thus not reliable. Depending on which algorithm is used to determine the time based on the comparison between processor cycles and reliable time source, the clock of a virtual IT system can lag behind the actual time or be ahead of it. In extreme cases, this can even cause the clock of the operating system to run backwards. This can result in undesired effects which significantly affect the security of the virtual infrastructure under unfavourable conditions.\nFor example, time stamps such as in the file system of a virtual machine with a clock that runs incorrectly are not reliable. As a consequence, inconsistencies might occur in the data backup if it determines, using the time stamps of the file system, what files are to be backed up.\nTroubleshooting in the event of problems is also sustainably impeded, as the chronology of the events which have caused the problem cannot be determined in a reliable manner. Moreover, evidentiary statements in the event of security incidents with incorrect time stamps in event logs are, at worst, impossible, since the correlation of events using the time stamps is not possible.\nIf procedures based on correct time stamps for the transmission of authentication keys (e.g.\nKerberos) are used for authentication in virtual IT systems, logins might fail.\nDifferent distributed database systems and directory services such as Active Directory use time stamps to check the consistency in the event of replication operations. If these time stamps are not reliable, inconsistencies might occur in these systems.\n", "examples": "For the remote access for telecommuters, a company has opted for a token-based authentication method. On the token, new pass phrases that must be entered together with the user names and passwords are generated at specific time intervals. The tokens carried along by the users are equipped with an internal clock synchronised with the time of the authentication server.\nAfter the authentication server has been virtualised, the users can no longer log in after a short period of time, since the one-time passwords displayed no longer match those on the authentication server. The accuracy of the clock in the virtual environment is not sufficient for this.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 3.103 Incorrect domain information", "description": "Even if the use of DNS has been planned carefully and, thus, all security-related aspects were taken into consideration, this is not sufficient if incorrect domain information is created. \"Incorrect\" means that semantic and/or syntactical errors were made when creating the domain information. For example, if a host name was assigned an incorrect IP address, data is missing or characters that are not permitted are used. If domain information contains errors, services using this information only function to a limited extent due to the incorrect information. The examples below include common errors:\n* For the forward resolution and the reverse resolution, data is updated in their own respective database. One of the most common errors is that newly added domain information is added to the data of the forward resolution. However, whoever adds this information forgets to also update the domain information in the data of the reverse resolution.\n* Multi-homed hosts, such as routers, have a network connection to several network segments and thus several IP addresses. If, for a multi-homed host, you forget to enter the corresponding PTR records (short form for \"pointer\") in the domain information for all IP addresses, a reverse resolution will fail for IP addresses without PTR records. Services requiring the reverse resolutions are thus impaired.\n* If characters which are not permitted are used in domain names, information is interpreted incorrectly and/or not all. Permitted characters include ASCII letters, numbers and the hyphen. Names valid in the DNS name space can also be interpreted differently by applications. \"0xe\", for example, is a valid host name. If you try to connect to this host using \"telnet 0xe\", Telnet will interpret \"0xe\" as an IP address. There is no name resolution, and if 0.0.0.14 is not the correct IP address, the connection will fail.\n* In domain information, serial numbers stating the date at which the zone was updated last must be entered. Writing the date as a decimal number might result in unexpected events, since dates are internally converted by DNS servers into an integer.\n* Resolving DNS servers as well as resolvers on pure client IT systems generally store the response data received in the cache. Thus, the number of required requests is reduced on the higher-level DNS server. The time period required for the temporary storage is referred to as \"time to live\" (TTL) and constitutes a part of the domain information. TTL times that are too long, especially for domain information which changes frequently, have the effect that buffered data is outdated. However, too short a TTL increases the load for DNS servers.\n* \"Glue records\" are required in certain cases in order to be able to find the responsible DNS servers. Usually, a DNS server only stores the domain names of the DNS servers of its subdomains. If a DNS server of such a subdomain is within its own subdomain, it is necessary that the higher-level DNS servers have also stored its IP address, since otherwise no DNS server would be able to perform a name resolution. This entry is referred to as glue record. It may happen that adapting or deleting the associated \"glue records\" is overlooked when DNS servers are migrated or withdrawn from operation. In the event of corresponding requests, data is then returned using DNS servers which no longer exist.\n* DNS offers the option of defining aliases. An alias is a freely chosen name which is usually easy to remember. An example of an often used alias in DNS is \"www\" for the web server. However, an alias must not be assigned any other data. It is, for example, not permitted to define an IP address for an alias. Another error regarding aliases is to delete a host, but not the associated alias.\n* Since domain information constitutes important data, it is usually provided by at least two DNS servers, the primary DNS server and one or several secondary DNS servers. The data is maintained on the primary DNS server and synchronised on the secondary DNS server(s).\nDNS servers use the serial numbers available in the domain information as an indicator stating whether changes have been made. If domain information is changed and the included serial number is not increased, the new domain information is not synchronised. The inconsistency resulting from this will lead to different name resolutions depending on which DNS server is requested.\nDomain information is stored in text files, so-called master files. If these text files are processed manually, an overly complicated, inconsistent structure constitutes an additional source of error.\nBesides adding new information, deleting information in particular, if a host is withdrawn from operation, constitutes a major source of error. If not all the domain information is deleted, information on hosts which no longer exist remains available.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.104 Incorrect configuration of a DNS server", "description": "Security-critical default settings, self-configured security-critical settings or incorrect configurations may cause a DNS server to not function properly and its availability is thus restricted. Furthermore, incorrect configurations facilitate attacks on the availability and integrity of the DNS server. For security-critical configurations, the following aspects in particular are important:\nDNS servers with superuser rights\nOperating a DNS server with superuser rights facilitates effective attacks on the IT system. If an attacker succeeds in attacking a DNS server process, he/she can work with the rights of the DNS server process and access all other processes of this computer as well as compromise other computers in the network.\nRecursive requests\nThere are two types of requests to a DNS server: iterative and recursive. For iterative requests, a\nDNS server only responds to requests if it has stored the desired information itself. This behaviour corresponds to an advertising DNS server. Otherwise, it refers to another DNS server. For recursive requests, a DNS server responds to all requests; this corresponds to a resolving DNS server. If the resolving DNS server itself has not stored the information, the server itself sends requests to other DNS servers in order to obtain the desired information. If a resolving DNS server is configured in such a manner that it accepts recursive requests without any restrictions, this can significantly impair the availability of the server due to the increase in the load. \"Without any restrictions\" in this case means that the resolving DNS server accepts recursive requests both from the internal LAN and from the Internet.\nIn addition, it is thus easier to perform cache poisoning attacks, as described in T 5.78 DNS spoofing for example. Basically, cache poisoning attacks work as follows: An attacker sends a recursive request to the resolving DNS server regarding domain information which this resolving\nDNS server has not stored. Then, the attacker tries to send a valid, manipulated response to the resolving DNS server. If a resolving DNS server accepts recursive requests only from its internal network, it will not resolve the attacker's request, but refer to the next responsible DNS server.\nThus, the server is not at risk due to the attack described above. If the DNS server accepts recursive requests without any restrictions and/or if the attacker is within the company network, this server is potentially at risk.\nZone transfers\nAs DNS is required by many network services, certain parts of the domain name space are not managed by a single DNS server, but usually at least by two DNS servers. In order to synchronise these servers, so-called zone transfers are performed. If zone transfers are not restricted to authorised DNS servers, each host that is able to send a request to the DNS server can read all the domain information of these servers by means of a zone transfer. If someone carries out a zone transfer without authorisation, this does not constitute direct damage for the information system, but the data obtained can facilitate later attacks.\nDynamic updates\nDynamic updates allow updating of domain information in an automated manner. In connection with DHCP in particular, dynamic updates play an important role. If a host is assigned an IP address by the DHCP server, this information must also be updated in the domain name space. This process can be performed using dynamic updates. A misconfiguration of dynamic updates may cause the following problems:\n* The authorisations were configured too restrictively so that the DNS server does not accept the updates of the internal DHCP server. Thus, it is not possible to update the domain information and requests are responded to using outdated, incorrect data.\n* If the authorisations are configured too generously, such a situation can constitute a potential opportunity for attack, as described in T 5.155 Exploitation of dynamic DNS updates.\nCryptography\nTo secure DNS, cryptography is often used. Errors in the configuration of the cryptographic keys, for example, result in connections being rejected or valid data being refused as invalid due to incorrect keys.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.105 Unapproved use of external services", "description": "It is a relatively common occurrence that employees use external services without this being coordinated within your organisation.

Typical examples for inappropriate conduct and resulting undesired effects are listed in the following.\nInsufficient response times\nWhen using Internet applications and e-mail, communication partners have high expectations regarding the time required by the person contacted to respond. If these expectations are not met, for example, due to the lack of an appropriate processing procedure, this can result in loss of profit, frustration of customers and employees, etc.\nLoss of control\nWhen information is published in Internet services or disclosed by e-mail, the author is no longer able to control who receives this information and what happens to it. This can result in undesired use or misuse of this information.\nMixture of private and work environment\nAs many IT systems (such as mobile phones, PDAs), applications, and services (such as social networks, web mail) are used for both work and private purposes a clear separation of the information used here between private and work environment is difficult. This can cause problems if attackers gather large amounts of data and evaluate this data for targeted attacks on individual persons or organisations, as, for example, in social engineering.\nLoss of confidentiality\nThe security of Internet applications is often misjudged or inappropriate safeguards are used for protection of information, for example, if information is disguised instead of encrypted. This results in unwanted disclosure of confidential information to the general public.\n", "examples": "* For easy exchange of data two contract partners stored files on a web server. The URL was communicated only to the trusted persons of the corresponding organisation by e-mail. The partners assumed that it was not possible to find these files via search engines.

Depending on the type and effect of a security incident this can undermine the trust of the public, the partners, the customers, but also the employees of the affected organisation.\nDamage to reputation can not only be a result of security incidents caused by force majeure or external attacks, but can also be triggered by improper behaviour of employees, for example, by unsound activities in the Internet, sending of chain e-mails, security incidents resulting from ignorance or incorrect implementation of security rules (theft of laptop with customer data, including credit card details and overview of the orders of the past years).\n", "examples": "* An employee of a large company did not abide by the policies established by the organisation when using Internet services and repeatedly attracted negative attention in discussion groups due to an inappropriate tone. This not only provoked antipathy towards this person, but towards the entire organisation as the employee was perceived as a representative of his company due to her electronic business card. As a result the company became known as being presumptuous and not operating professionally. A special marketing campaign was required in order to restore the company's reputation.\n* A field service employee lost an USB stick during a train journey without noticing.

The finder sold the data on the Internet. As a result, fraudulent debit transfers occurred with some customers. The subsequent police investigation revealed that these transfers were linked to the loss of the USB stick. This resulted in negative press reports and a major loss in confidence of partners and customers.\n* Mid-December 2008 the chief editor of a big German newspaper received an anonymous parcel which contained confidential data of 130,000 customers of a bank. This included accounting statements of credit card customers, PINs for debit and credit cards, lists of cash flows, international debit transfers, and remittance transfers.

When using several methods to change the system, this may create inconsistencies because the changes are stored in different configuration files and no synchronisation is made between these files. Moreover, security settings may cancel each other out or complicate the administration of the client under Mac OS X.\nFor example, when configuring SSH it is possible to modify the file \"/etc/sshd_config\" both directly and via the graphical user interface available in the \"System Preferences\" under \"Sharing\". The settings made are stored in different configuration files and will not be synchronised. So it can be possible, even though the SSH configuration files are correct, that no remote access via SSH is possible because the content of the configuration files is contradictory.\n", "examples": "* A smaller company employs two administrators.

This encryption uses the AES-128 algorithm. Users may only access the FileVault-encrypted data after entering the correct password. The password should be sufficiently secure.\nPasswords may be forgotten or unavailable in case of absence of a person.\nIn such case, the master FileVault password can be used to read such data. The locally defined master FileVault password makes it possible to encrypt all user folders of the corresponding IT system or to reset the corresponding password. If the master FileVault password is stored at an unsecured location, unauthorised persons may access the encrypted information.\nIf both the user password and the master FileVault password get lost, e.g. due to fire or theft, access to the FileVault-encrypted data will not be possible any more. The master FileVault password is protected by a weaker algorithm (RSA-1024); correspondingly, it is exposed to a higher risk as compared to the user passwords.\nFileVault is not able to encrypt the whole hard disk. Correspondingly, an attacker having physical access to the hard disk or a user account may also access sensitive configuration data and/or folders. This includes, for example:\n* log files in /Library/Logs and /var/log ,\n* cache and temporary files in /Library/Caches and /tmp,\n* system-wide settings in /Library/Preferences ,\n* own source code in /Developer , or * any additional programs stored out of the user folder.\nUnauthorised persons may also gain access to the information when users are authorised to log in at the client without authentication (\"Automatic login\"). In such case, the information protected by FileVault will be automatically decrypted without query for a password when starting the computer.\nAnother problem may be created by the program \"Time Machine\". \"Time Machine\" is used for data backup under Mac OS X and may create copies of whole hard disks, individual directories, or FileVault-encrypted user folders. However, the information is always stored unencrypted on the data backup medium; the type of medium is irrelevant. Care must be taken that the backup media are stored at a location that prevents access of unauthorised persons.\nIt must also be taken into account that data backup using \"Time Machine\" can only be performed with activated FileVault after the user logged out of the system.

The staff members do not switch off the computers during the lunch break, but only switch them to sleep mode. After several days of work in the system without switching off in between, a hardware malfunction occurs, resulting in data loss. As the computers have never been switched off, FileVault did not allow backup by \"Time Machine\".

This variety of functions is achieved by the modular structure of the application and the comprehensive adaptability as open source software. In addition, it is a client-server architecture requiring configurations both on the server and on the client side. All in all, OpenLDAP is a highly complex application.\nFrom an improper configuration, the following threats might arise among other things:\n* Administrators might perform adaptations to the configuration of OpenLDAP which are technologically feasible, but not admissible from a technical perspective. For example, an administrator might change a default schema of OpenLDAP to obtain additional attributes for directory service objects. When using globally uniform default schemata, this results in incompatibilities with other directory services and might cause problems during updates of OpenLDAP or during the migration to another directory service. The improper implementation might also violate LDAP standards.\n* Incorrect entries in the central configuration files of the slapd server might result in an undesired behaviour of the server or in the server becoming unusable, for example when a database is accidentally set into a read-only-state. For improper instructions to backends, it is possible that data is lost if such instructions do not match the database used, for instance.\n* OpenLDAP can be installed from the binary packages provided for an operating system distribution. For several distributions, the slapd server is started automatically with a default configuration after the installation has been completed. Such a default configuration is often inadequate; in general, safeguards such as the encryption of communication connections are often not configured.\n* Configuration settings can be made in the wrong file. If, for example, the user settings are entered in the file for global client settings (usually ldap.conf) instead of in the correct file (usually ~/.ldaprc), they remain ineffective in most cases. If client settings are added to the configuration of the server (usually slapd.conf), they might impair the operability of the entire system. This applies, for example, if the setting, useful for clients, that a communication partner must authenticate using a certificate, is applied to the servers. Most clients do not have an appropriate certificate.\n* Access Control Lists (ACLs) are an essential security mechanism of OpenLDAP. The effectiveness of the access right management depends heavily on the correct configuration of the ACLs. If, for instance, a specific user is to be prohibited from accessing a directory service, an administrator can realise this by means of a corresponding access rule at the end of the existing set of rules. However, such a rule does often not become effective, since checking the set of rules is terminated after the first applicable criterion.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 3.111 Inadequate separation of offline and online access to OpenLDAP", "description": "For accessing the data managed using OpenLDAP, i.e. objects in the directory service and configuration settings, there are the following access options:\n* via the LDAP log using the ldap* tools with the slapd server running (also referred to as online access),\n* via direct access to the database files of the BerkeleyDB using the slap*tools of OpenLDAP irrespective of the slapd server (also referred to as offline access),\n* by means of database manipulation using the BerkeleyDB tools of Oracle and * by means of direct manipulation of configuration files in the file system.\nHere, the different access options and tools fulfil partially or completely identical functions. If the access options mixed or if the respective method of operation is not understood, numerous error situations might occur.\n", "examples": "* In a company, the records stored by OpenLDAP are backed up in the LDIF format using the slapcat offline tool.

It can be used to perform wide-ranging configuration changes to\nWindows installations in image files of hard disks. DISM can be applied to Windows Image Format files (WIM) as well as virtual hard disks (VHD). Both are used in customised provision of a Windows system. In some cases, it is also possible to apply DISM to running systems.\nUnauthorised changes could be made to installation sources or IT systems without being noticed, either accidentally or by an attacker. Both cases can result in disruptions to the provision process, damage to the security configuration of the installation, and also the circulation of malicious codes.\nThe Windows image format is a file-based image format (WIM) which may contain installation sources for Windows Vista or Server 2008 and higher versions. A WIM file can contain more than one Windows edition.\nThe most important functions of DISM are:\n* Windows Edition Servicing Commands for changing the Windows image * Unattended Servicing Commands for implementing changes without user interaction * Driver Servicing Commands for integration of device drivers in an image\n* International Servicing Commands for configuration of language packs\n* Application Servicing Commands for integration of applications in images\n* Package Servicing Commands for integration of packages in images or running systems\nIn particular, the command /Apply-Unattended in the Unattended Service Commands can be used to import individual files containing malicious codes to an existing image, without this being noticed by the administrator responsible. This feature is particularly critical in connection with the optional specification of a control file in XML format, since it allows automatic installation of several files.\nThe Application Servicing Commands can be used to identify whether a specific application is contained in an image. This can be achieved, for example, by means of the command /Get-AppInfo. Alternatively, all applications contained in an image can be listed by means of the command /Get-Apps. The list of the files contained in the image makes it possible to attempt attacks against specific software versions.\nThe commands /Add-Package and /Remove-Package in the Package Servicing Commands make it possible to replace entire packages under Windows 7 by means of DISM. This makes it easier for a potential attacker to replace files, since several files can be replaced at a time using only one command.\nLarge collective images allow too much room for uncontrolled changes with potentially adverse impacts on the later installation. Individual software components in a collective image can be enabled by means of /Enable-Feature and /Disable-Feature. There is no declaration or clear definition.

Selecting the relevant messages from the large number of different log events is a particular challenge.\nNumerous messages are only of an informative character and divert attention from the messages that are actually important. This is particularly applicable to cases where centralised logging is used, because numerous IT systems send their messages to the centralised logging server.\nIf too many log messages are selected, the wealth of information can hardly be analysed and requires huge amounts of time. Furthermore, there is the risk of logged data being deleted or overwritten when the internal memory or the hard disk capacity of the logging server selected was too small. If the number of recorded log messages is too small or if an insufficient number of relevant log messages are recorded, security-critical incidents may remain undetected. This problem is often caused by incorrectly configured filter functions of an IT early-warning system.\nDifferent formats\nLog files are stored in different formats and sorted in a different order. This depends on the different manufacturers of the applications and processes the collected information comes from. For example, the date and time information in an operating system log file can be found at a different location than in a log file of the web server.\nLogged system messages are used for error finding and in order to clarify security incidents. The messages can also be used in connection with an IT early-warning system. In order to get an overview of the accumulating data, the data must be correlated. For this, the logged data is normalised, i.e. converted to a uniform format.\nProblems regarding applications and IT systems\nAlong with general logging aspects, problems regarding the applications and IT systems to be monitored may also occur. For example, the focus of a security gateway (firewall) or other network components could incorrectly be directed towards prohibited activities such as denied connections. The analysis of admissible activities, e.g. a correctly established connection, is neglected. At the same time, this very information may be indicative of a successful attempted attack, for example, if an attacker guesses the correct password of a user by trial and error.\n", "examples": "Within an information system, the centralised logging server is overloaded time and time again. The reason for this is that the Windows event messages are transmitted and stored redundantly to the logging server. For example, log entries are generated both on the respective client and on the domain controller during login and logout procedures and transmitted to the logging server. These overloads may cause the deletion of other logged information containing relevant events such as information about an attack. The consequences include gaps in the monitoring of the information system.\n* The Exchange server of a company is to be integrated into the IT early-warning system and monitored. The main task of the early-warning system is to record all emails sent using the Exchange server. The administrator must log SMTP transactions on the Exchange server for this.

For example, correlating a violation regarding a security gateway (firewall) with unsuccessful login attempts may fail. This risk is particularly applicable if centralised logging is used. Without a common time basis, messages of different IT systems cannot be correlated.\nThe time and date settings for a time stamp function very often depend on regional settings. For example, the date is written in the style of MM/DD/YYYY (month/day/year, e.g. (05/09/2009) in the Anglo-Saxon region. This may cause misinterpretations within the framework of automatic analysis, for example as by an IT early-warning system.\nFurthermore, often the year is not specified in the log files, first and foremost with Unix systems.\nThis is particularly problematic regarding the validity of the data if events further back in time must be considered and if these cannot be sorted chronologically.\nExamples\n* Within an information system, a centralised logging server is commissioned. The entire network is equipped with a time interval by an internal NTP server within the LAN. The information system is subjected to several attacks, within the framework of which the NTP server is compromised. In this way, the time distributed by the NTP server is changed so that the remainder of the IT systems disposes of a different time when compared to the logging server. As a consequence, the logged data of the IT systems is inconsistent and cannot be compared with each other.\n* A German company integrates a new security gateway (firewall) developed and manufactured outside of Europe into its information system. Since all IT systems and applications within the company are monitored by means of an IT early-warning system, this security gateway is also integrated. The setting that all logged data with a date differing from the current data must trigger an alarm is enabled in the IT early-warning system. This way, possible manipulations of the logged data is to be detected. The early-warning system interprets the date in the form DD/MM/YY (day/month/year). However, the log files of the new security gateway provide the date information in the format MM/DD/YY\n(month/day/year).

Most of these malfunctions are so short (less than one second long) that consumers do not even notice them. However, interruptions lasting longer than 10 ms can cause disruptions to IT operations. While taking measurements at about 60 measuring points in Germany in 1983, approximately 100 such power drops were registered. Of these failures, five lasted up to one hour, and one lasted even longer than an hour. These interruptions were due solely to failures in the power supply system. In addition, interruptions can also be caused by switching off the wrong equipment when performing scheduled maintenance or by cables damaged by excavation work.\nNote that not only the obvious, direct consumers of electricity (PCs, lighting, etc.) depend on the power supply. All infrastructural equipment used today depends directly or indirectly on electrical power, e.g. lifts, pneumatic mail systems, air conditioning technology, alarm systems, security gates, automatic door closing units, sprinkler systems, and private branch exchanges for telephones. Even the water supply in high-rise buildings depends on electricity to generate water pressure in the upper floors using pumps.\nThe liberalisation of the electricity market in some industrial countries resulted in a poorer level of service. For this reason, the risk of problems due to failures of the power supply or due to switching operations at national power transfer points could increase, even in Germany.\n", "examples": "In a large industrial plant in southern Germany, the entire power supply was interrupted for several hours because of technical problems at the power utility company. Consequently, production was interrupted and all computers failed in the development departments not equipped with a backup power supply.\n* Due to an error in the UPS of a computer centre, the UPS did not switch back to normal operation after a brief power failure. After about 40 minutes, the batteries were empty and all the computers in the affected server room failed.\n* At the beginning of 2001, there was a power emergency in California that lasted over 40 days. The power supply situation was so tight that the Californian Independent System Operator mandated rolling blackouts. These power outages, which lasted up to 90 minutes, not only affected households, but also companies in the high-tech industry. Since the power failure also caused alarm systems and surveillance cameras to be switched off, the power supply company kept their rolling blackout timetables secret.\n* In November of 2005, many communities in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia were without power for days after heavy snowfall because numerous power line towers had collapsed under the weight of the snow and ice. It took several days to restore power.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.2 Failure of internal supply networks", "description": "Buildings normally house a number of supply and disposal networks that therefore serve as a foundation for all business processes in an organisation, including its IT.

The storage systems failed because the air conditioning system was not connected to the emergency power supply (EPS) and because adequate remote monitoring capabilities for the supply technology were not installed in the computer centre. The IT systems continued to operate due to the EPS, but without any air conditioning.

This phenomenon is encountered in the (analogue) telephone network. There, calls of other network participants can be heard. However, these often do not respond to the request \"to clear the line\" because cross-talk is confined to one direction. Checking one^s own lines for coupled-in, other-source signals does not yield any information on whether one^s own signals cause cross-talk in other lines and whether they can thus be monitored.\nThe main differences compared to other line faults is that, apart from disruption of signal transmission on adjacent lines, exploitable information may be available on other lines due to cross-talk.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.6 Voltage fluctuations / overvoltage / undervoltage", "description": "Fluctuations in the supply voltage can result in malfunctions and damage to the IT systems.

This protection mechanism is bypassed, though, through the use of services such as FTP or Telnet because plain text passwords are used again in this case.\nApart from the fact that all of these processes can open security gaps due to incorrect or faulty configuration, the probability that these processes contain security-related programming errors is naturally significantly higher due to their complexity.\nThere are a number of different ways to connect a z/OS system to internal and public networks.\nAccess is possible via SNA and TCP/IP, e.g. FTP, TELNET, or using a browser.

With a failure or malfunction of one or more of these components, communication between the workstation and server systems is still possible, but the available bandwidth in the network is restricted, because redundant signal paths might no longer be available or load balancing in the network might be impaired.\n## Example: Failure of one of the redundant switches 1-1 or 1-2 as shown in the diagram below can restrict the available bandwidth for communications between the workstations and the server.\nFigure: Failure of a redundant switch\nThe MTBFs (Mean Time Between Failure) quoted by the manufacturers of the components can be used to estimate the risk of failure.\nIn the case of hubs, there are basically two different techniques of establishing connections between individual modules, and therefore between the segments connected. As regards products with a passive backplane - the element which establishes connections between modules - these backplanes provide only the electrical connections between the modules. The control unit as such is integrated in the individual modules. In the case of products with an active backplane, this element provides additional functions such as configurable communications between the modules, signal amplification etc. In general, active network components with an active backplane are more susceptible to malfunctions than active network components with a passive backplane. The failure of an active backplane leads to a complete breakdown of communications within the affected network component. In contrast, passive backplanes are designed in such a way that only mechanical violence or force majeure (e.g. lightning) can damage them. In many cases, component faults can be attributed to the related power supply units, as the components require a stable power supply. For this reason, many components are delivered with redundant power supply units or can be refitted with them. The failure of a passive network component can impair the availability of a network to the same extent. This applies, for example, to cables and connectors which link segments together. Such a threat can arise as a result of improper cable installation (e.g.\nnon-observance of the maximum bending radius), incorrect installation of connectors (particularly in the case of optic fibres) and interference due to electromagnetic incompatibility.\n## Example: If a damaged cable or connector disrupts the link between switches 3 and 1 as shown in the diagram below, workstations 3 and 4 are still able to communicate with each other, but no longer with the servers or workstations 1 and 2. The communication between workstations 3 and 4 will still be possible.\nFigure: Failure of a switch\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.32 Failure to dispatch a message", "description": "The exchange of data via groupware and web applications is fast and convenient, but not always reliable. In particular, the reliability of e-mail is overestimated on a regular basis. Messages are lost on a regular basis due to hardware and software errors in the IT systems involved, or interference in transmission lines. These technical problems can have multiple causes. For example, cables can be damaged, network switching elements can be defective or the communication software can be incorrectly configured. E-mails can also be lost because the recipient's address was incorrect. The biggest problem in this case is that users are often not informed about failures to deliver e-mail.\nMechanisms designed to automatically indicate failures to deliver messages are not completely reliable.\nMany e-mail programs offer options such as \"Confirm dispatch\" or \"Confirm receipt\". However, such confirmations should not be overvalued. Often, these confirmations are not issued on the arrival of e-mail at the recipient's workstation, but on arrival at the mail server. No indication is given of whether or not this server has successfully forwarded the e-mail to the intended recipient.

This is especially critical if the failure is not noticed and encryption cannot be executed any more due to the malfunction even though the users rely on the cryptographic module to protect the confidentiality of the data.\n* encrypted data cannot be decrypted any more as long as the required encryption module is not available. This may give rise to availability issues for IT applications further processing the decrypted data.\n* if the encryption module is working faultily without any complete failure, data is encrypted incompletely or incorrectly.

Without corresponding data backups, this may mean a total loss of the data.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.35 Insecure cryptographic algorithms", "description": "The extent to which cryptographic processes increase security basically depends on two parameters: secure cryptographic algorithms must be used and the secret keys must be treated confidentially (for the compromising of cryptographic codes see T 5.83 Compromising cryptographic keys).\nInsecure cryptographic algorithms are characterised by the fact that a potential attacker would be able to break the cryptographic procedure used with a reasonable amount of resources. In terms of encryption algorithms, this means that an attacker would be able to determine the original plain text from the encrypted text without having any additional information. The corresponding resources required by an attacker such as the available computing power, aids such as analysis tools, current level of knowledge, amount of time available, knowledge of vulnerabilities, etc., can be considered relevant. If insecure cryptographic algorithms are used, then the attacker has the opportunity to bypass the cryptographic protection.\nEvery cryptographic algorithm used must be examined to determine whether or not it is insecure.\nThere are a few criteria, though, that indicate the possible existence of security gaps:\n* If secret keys whose effective length is less than 60 bits are used for a symmetric encryption method, then it is already possible today to crack every key with moderate computing power by trying out all possible keys. As the performance of computers increases, it can be assumed that this limit will rise to over 100 bits in the future.\n* If algorithms whose security is based on the problem of factoring large numbers are used for asymmetric encryption and signature methods, then it is assumed today that key lengths of less than 1024 bits should be considered insecure. This is due to the progress in the development of efficient factorisation algorithms, which can factor numbers approximately 500 bits long nowadays using massive computing power. In addition, the potential for the development of optoelectronic accelerators to perform the most important steps in the calculations used in these algorithms, which would speed up the algorithms considerably, also needs to be taken into account.\n* Hash functions that convert a character string of any length to a hash value with a constant bit length can be considered insecure if the constant length of the hash value is lower than 128 bits because otherwise it is possible to find two different character strings that produce the same hash value.\n* Cryptographic algorithms that have been designed by inexperienced developers and have not been examined by the scientific community should be considered potentially insecure because many years of experience are required to develop secure cryptographic algorithms.\n* Unpublished cryptographic algorithms whose software runs unusually fast should be considered potentially insecure algorithms. Experience has shown that secure algorithms usually need to be based on complex mathematical functions.\nRandom numbers are often needed when applying cryptographic methods. Poorly designed random number generators can return values that are predictable. This would make the cryptographic checksums used to ensure the integrity of messages completely worthless, for example.\nAn example of an algorithm fitting these criteria is the DES algorithm for symmetric encryption used frequently around the world. This algorithm has an effective key length of 56 bits. The triple-DES algorithm, which executes the algorithm three times in a row using two different keys has an effective key length of 112 bits and can still be considered adequately secure at the present time. Another example is the RSA algorithm, which is an asymmetric procedure based on the factorisation problem. If RSA is operated with a key length of less than 768 bits, then it must be assumed that it will not offer adequate security. A key length of at least 1024 bits can still be considered sufficiently secure, at least for the next few years.\nThe MD5 hash algorithm is outdated and has known weaknesses that can be demonstrated today based on practical examples. Even the SHA-1 hash algorithm is not suitable any more for all applications or purposes.\nA common example of an insecure but extremely fast algorithm is the use of the XOR function, which can easily be used to link the constant values to the original plain text. This is a high performance algorithm, but it can be cracked very quickly. On the other hand, the XOR function is used in the most secure encryption algorithm that exists by XORing unpredictable, random values with the data to be encrypted (one-time pad).\nIt is practically impossible for a non-expert to determine if a given cryptographic algorithm is sufficiently secure. For this reason, only those algorithms that have been developed by experts or that have been subjected to years of examination by the scientific community should be used.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.36 Mistakes in encrypted data", "description": "If data is present in encrypted form and if this data is changed, it is possible that the data cannot be decrypted properly any more during decryption. Depending on the mode of operation of the encryption routines, this may mean that only a few bytes are encrypted improperly or that the entire data is encrypted improperly after the mistake. If there is no data backup, this may result in a total loss of data.\nThe mentioned mistakes in the encrypted data may be caused as follows:\n* a transmission error that cannot be remedied occurs while the encrypted data is being transmitted\n* an irreparable error occurs on the data medium (diskette, hard disk)\n* a computer virus manipulates the data\n* a third party deliberately manipulates the data by manipulating the encrypted data at a few locations using an editor program, for example\nIn unfavourable cases, e.g. in the event of a bit loss or when the amounts of data changed are too large and the error is propagated, the data cannot be recovered even if the cryptographic procedure and the keys used for encryption are known.\nA mistake in the cryptographic keys used may be even more critical. When a single bit of a cryptographic key is changed, this may already result in the data encrypted using this key no longer being decryptable. In the absence of a data backup of the cryptographic key, this data is lost.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.37 Lack of reliability of groupware", "description": "In many cases, groupware services substitute the traditional approach, for example email substitutes the traditional communication by mail, calendars or address books are maintained online. However, the fact that these services are only insufficiently reliable in the absence of additional security safeguards is often disregarded. This refers both to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these services and the information processed using them.\nFailures and loss of messages\nThe exchange of data via groupware and services such as email is fast and convenient, but not always reliable. Messages are lost on a regular basis due to hardware and software errors in the IT systems involved, or interference in transmission lines. These technical problems may have multiple reasons; for example, cables may be damaged, network switching elements may be defective, or the communication software may be configured incorrectly. Emails may also be lost, because the recipient's address was entered incorrectly. The biggest problem in this case is that users are often not informed about failures to deliver email.

This means unauthorised persons may possibly view the schedule of groups or individual persons using calendar services. This may be used to prepare different types of attacks in a targeted manner, e.g. burglaries, social engineering, corporate espionage.\nWith unencrypted emails, all information can be read on every IT system the message is processed on along its way through the network. Since the exact route generally cannot be predicted, an email may pass through a lot of different systems.\nInformation which is not protected with the help of digital signatures may also be modified or deleted on every system involved without the recipient having any way of noticing this. In addition to modifications to the text or possible file attachments of an email, information such as the sending and forwarding data or the sender's address may be modified, see also T 5.73 Impersonation of wrong sender.\nTherefore, it is wrong to compare emails to classic letters. Comparing emails to postcards would be more appropriate.\n## Examples:\nAn employee sent emails with the sender information of his boss containing work instructions to different colleagues.\n* Practically all of the large amount of spam emails spamming the email mailboxes on a daily basis are equipped with a forged sender's address.\n* Usually, the local system time on the computer of the sender is entered as the date the email was sent.

Some of the problems that this causes are described in the following section.\nFailure of managed components\nIf components managed by a network management system or a system management system fail while the system is in operation, then, depending on the type of management system, this can result in the management information ceasing to be updated automatically. As a rule, for example in the case of network management systems, the system administrator is only informed of the failure of the component. If, for example, the failure of the component is observed or deliberately caused by perpetrators, they can bring their own computer into the system outside the LAN and pass it off as the failed component (IP spoofing). This computer can be used for further attacks whereby it has the rights of an internal computer (such as entering false management information).\nFailure of monitoring components\nIf parts of a management system fail while the system is in operation (also unnoticed), then the system components monitored or managed by these components are no longer connected to the management system. New instructions from the management then cease to be implemented on these computers. The consequence of this is that inconsistent system configurations arise, which can then cause security problems.\nUnavailability of the central management station\nIf the central management station in a network managed by a management system fails, the system can no longer be managed centrally. If the station is unavailable for a long period of time, for example because the hardware cannot be replaced at short notice due to missing maintenance contracts, routine functions such as data backup may no longer be performed. If uncoordinated manual alterations are made to the individually-managed systems, this will lead to inconsistencies and maybe even security problems.\nFailure of network switching elements during the transmission of management information\nWhen a management system is used to manage a computer network, it is necessary to exchange so-called management information between the individual components of the management system. The information is transmitted via the local area network. Local area networks usually (depending on the network technique used) consist of several subnetworks which are linked together by network switching elements such as routers. In the process, the network switching elements pass on data from one subnetwork to another. If the switching elements fail, this corresponds to the affected subnetworks being separated physically. It is then no longer possible to exchange management information. Yet there is usually a subnetwork which can still be managed from the management station in use at the time and a subnetwork which can no longer be managed. Depending on how long the switching element cannot be reached, this leads to inconsistencies and security problems.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.39 Software design errors", "description": "When planning programs and protocols, it is possible to make security-related design errors. In many cases, these errors are entirely understandable from a historical point of view.

A special case of this is referred to as an FTP bounce attack, which exploits the ability to use the FTP data transmission protocol to open a connection to any other computer. In the worst-case scenario, this type of attack may even be able to bypass a firewall using dynamic packet filters (see CERT Advisory 97-27). There are certainly other errors in the Internet protocols to be discovered and published in the future.\n* Another example of a design error is referred to as DNS spoofing (see also T 5.78 DNS spoofing). The domain name system is the central information service in the Internet and it allows easily remembered web site names such as www.valuesave.com to be translated to the corresponding Internet address. In DNS spoofing, the attacker attempts to assign the name of a web site to the wrong computer so that users looking for information are redirected to the wrong computer.\n* Another example of a design error is allowing users the ability to send large numbers of advertising emails (mail spamming). In this case, the attacker uses someone else's email server as a remailer so that the reactions of the recipients to the spam emails are ineffective. The reason for attacks clearly lies in the poor authentication mechanisms currently available in the Internet.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.40 Unsuitable fitting out of the RAS client operational environment", "description": "This threat was eliminated in 2008 with the 10th version of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.41 Non-availability of the mobile communication network", "description": "The availability of mobile communication networks is significantly lower than that of landline networks.

An overload must not necessarily lead to a complete system halt. It is also possible for various system resources to simply be no longer available, even though the system itself is still responding. The following situations are typical, but are not the only threats of this type.\nSpool full situation\nThe spool file in a Job Entry Subsystem (JESx) is only intended to be used for a certain volume of output data. It may occur that, for example, unlimited data are written to the spool file in the JESx due to a program loop. This action can lead to a spool full situation, new batch jobs can no longer be started. Only the online processes actually running will remain, in some circumstances, active, provided no output files are written to the spool file. As many JES commands require a useable spool file for execution, this situation may mean that extensive (and time-consuming) recovery measures are necessary to rectify the problem.\nComplete system halt\nUnix processes in the USS subsystem (Unix System Services) are mapped to address spaces in z/OS. If sufficient memory is no longer available, these address spaces must be swapped to page disks using the Auxiliary Storage Manager (ASM). If these are also insufficient, it is no longer possible to add any address space.\nIf the number of Unix processes in the USS is not limited and there is insufficient space on the page disks, security problems can result from the starting too many Unix processes. The cause, for instance, can be a recursive function that incessantly starts new Unix processes. As a consequence the system may practically come to a halt.\nz/OS (with 64-bit addressing) is considerably less affected by this problem compared to its predecessor, OS/390 (with 31-bit addressing), due to the increased addressing available. As a result of the increased addressing available, more memory can be provided to the z/OS system. This factor has the consequence that the page disks are required much later.\nIn general, commands or program routines that continuously start new processes can rapidly overload the system. In the end this situation can make an Initial Program Load (IPL ) necessary.\nSystem overload due to an excessive number of JESx initiators\nThe administrator controls the batch processing and its priorities based on the number of initiators started. If too few initiators are started, queues can be produced during batch processing. If too many initiators are started, resources may be overloaded.\nIf too many batch jobs are started, there is a risk that the page datasets will be insufficient. This situation would require manual intervention by the operators in the system configuration.\nIf the job entry subsystem has been defined with a very large number of initiators that, however, are not activated immediately, it may occur that on the entry of the JES2 commando $SI (instead of e. g. $SI1-10), all possible initiators are started. As a result more batch jobs than planned may run in certain circumstances. Although as a rule this situation will not lead to a system halt, response times may become significantly longer.\nDelayed tape processing\nIf more tape units are requested simultaneously than there are stations present, the backup of the data to tape will be delayed. The backup jobs enter the wait status and wait for free tape stations.\nExamples\n* Too many initiators were started in a z/OS installation. This situation had the consequence that during the batch processing, too many batch jobs were activated simultaneously, resulting in a very heavy load on the system^s CPU. Although the System was able to withstand the load, the situation led to long response times for the Time Sharing Option (TSO).\n* In the USS basic definitions for a z/OS operating system, the values for MAXPROCSYS and MAXFILEPROC were set to very high figures.

As a result, anybody who has access to the IT system can access all data and programs, and also internal data belonging to the organisation or very personal data belonging to the owner.\nOther, unfortunately very typical vulnerabilities on portable components such as PDAs are:\n* inadequate access protection and authentication mechanisms * no facility or an inadequate facility for encrypting data * insecure synchronisation\n* no logging facilities or inadequate logging facilities\nA large number of different PDA models with a very wide range of operating systems are available.

A loss of data can result from the theft or the loss of the device, but also from technical problems or simply a power cut.\nPortable data media and devices are often stolen as well since they can be used universally, but also sometimes specifically to gain access to internal information. One of the most common causes of lost data when using portable data media is the loss of the data medium itself. Surveys have shown that every other person surveyed has misplaced, forgotten, or lost a USB stick, a memory card, or some other type of portable data medium. Sensitive data can fall into the wrong hands in this case when the data media are not completely encrypted.\nDue to their portability, portable IT systems are not always online. For this reason, the data stored on them is not always up-to-date. This affects calendar entries as well as general information, but can also affect security under certain circumstances. It is also impossible to obtain information on recent security problems, update the virus scanner, etc., when the system is not connected to the organisation's IT systems and information sources.\n", "examples": "* A brand-new PDA falls out of someone's shirt pocket and breaks into pieces on the floor tiles, or a dog retrieves a hand-held device instead of the newspaper, unfortunately with the corresponding consequences.

However, some data may be lost completely if the backup battery is also empty, causing the loss of all unsynchronised data.\n* Data can also be lost when portable data media and devices are synchronised with other IT systems. In general, settings must be specified prior to synchronisation to define how to handle any conflicts arising during synchronisation of the data: For example, if files with the same name are found during synchronisation, it must be specified if the files should be copied from the portable end device to the stationary end device (or vice-versa) without prompting, or if a prompt should appear. This setting is often configured once when the docking station is used for the first time and is then forgotten over time. However, when data is then changed on a different end device than was originally intended, important data can be lost very quickly. This can also be an unpleasant side effect when, for example, several users synchronise their PDAs with the same end device without considering the fact that files with the same name may be overwritten in this case.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.53 Insecure default settings for storage components", "description": "Storage components are often delivered by the manufacturer with insecure default configurations which endanger the ability to use the component securely.\nThe following aspects are often problematic:\nOperating system\nStorage systems are often delivered with an outdated version of the operating system. The outdated version often does not meet the current security standards.\nHostnames\nDefault hostnames often give away the name of the manufacturer of the device. Attackers are then able to target known security gaps in these devices.\nServices\nDevices are usually delivered with a default factory configuration in which numerous services are enabled. These services may include, for example, HTTP, Telnet, FINGER, or other such services that should be disabled on storage systems for security reasons.\nUser accounts and passwords\nThe user accounts set up by the manufacturer often use documented, and therefore generally known, default user names and passwords. There are lists with manufacturer-specific default user account names and passwords available for download on relevant websites so that it is easy for unauthorised persons to obtain access to a system.\nInsecure SNMP versions\nAuthentication is performed in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 using only a single unencrypted so-called community string. Almost all manufacturers set the default read community string to \"public\", while the write community string is usually set to \"private\".

It is best suited for use on stand-alone user computers and exposed client computers that are sometimes used outside of the protected IT environment. The main intention with EFS is to protect the confidentiality of dedicated local data.\nThe threats mentioned in T 2.19 Inadequate key management for encryption can cause the EFS certificates used for encryption and decryption to be disclosed or lost in a number of ways. On a file server, this would then mean that large amounts of data are not confidential or not available any more, which can be fatal on a file server, in contrast to the situation on a single client computer. In turn, this means that data loss relating to copying or moving data also plays an important role on a server and can lead to the loss of or damage to large amounts of data. When administrators are not adequately aware of such effects or of the complex requirements, the higher level of security intended by the use of an activated EFS can easily be lost. If the users and administrators are also careless due to the assumed high level of security, then critical data may even be at higher risk than without activated EFS. In the following, some aspects of this problem are explained in more detail.\nWith EFS, it is impossible to guarantee the confidentiality of encrypted data on remote servers due to the administrators. An administrator has the ability to access encrypted data at any time using authorisations and the integrated data recovery procedure.\nThe EFS is completely transparent to users and applications. This means that each process and each application executed in the user's context has access to the encrypted files. EFS therefore does not provide any protection against malware like Trojan horses and viruses. EFS is not a replacement for careful administration of the NTFS access authorizations (e.g. of the Access Control Lists, ACL). Encrypted files can be deleted by users or applications regardless of whether or not they are protected by the EFS when the users or applications have sufficient authorisation in NTFS.\nThe transparency is so extensive that users generally do not know if the data is encrypted or decrypted. Note, though, that only the files on data media formatted with NTFS are encrypted.\nWhen these files are copied and moved to storage media using another file system, the files are stored in unencrypted form on the media.\nLack of control over EFS certificates\nEFS requires defined central key management. If a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is not used, then self-signed certificates of the local computer (client or server) are used instead. This means there is a significant risk when using EFS of losing access to the encrypted files when a key is lost.\nIf data is encrypted on a server that is a member of a domain by a client using the EFS, then this server must request an EFS certificate on behalf of the client user. This is only possible when the domain account of the server is granted extended privileges. The server object is trusted in the domain for delegation purposes. This \"representation\" and \"trust\" can be obtained using the\nKerberos protocol, but due to the design, the level of security of the Kerberos environment is lower. If the trusted server becomes compromised, the attacker can influence the data of the users. If the trust settings are not configured correctly and are restricted to the EFS-related services, then it is also possible for attackers to manipulate other areas of the server or domain.\nIf EFS certificates are created in the remote server or in the active directory, it will become more difficult to manage and protect the key material.\nUsing the EFS API\nWhen an application needs to access encrypted files encrypted for several different users, the application must support the corresponding Application Programming Interface (API) that is available in Windows Server 2003/Windows XP and higher. Otherwise, the keys of the additional users will be removed from the files. No user other than the user who created the file will have access to the particular file any more. The use of backup, archive, and synchronisation tools from third party manufacturers also entails similar risks as soon as they are used to process the encrypted files.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.55 Data loss relating to password resets in Windows Server 2003/XP and higher", "description": "Windows operating systems Windows Server 2003, Windows XP and higher protect the private keys of local user accounts from being used by administrators. A \"local user account\" means that the user name and password for the account are only available and can only be used on the corresponding computer. In previous Windows versions, an administrator was able to reset the password for a local user account and then export and use the private keys of the user. In Windows\nServer 2003/XP and higher, the cryptographic API deletes all private keys stored for a such a user account as soon as the password is reset by an administrator. This response makes it possible to hide information of the utmost confidentiality even from administrators. However, all private keys are lost after the password is reset by an administrator if no backup copies were made. Encrypted data in emails and files will not be available any more in this case.\nThis response can also lead to the loss of the private keys of the recovery agent for the Encrypting\nFile System (EFS) if the recovery agent was assigned to a local user account. In this case, a recovery agent may be configured. As access to the keys of the user account is not possible, this scenario corresponds to an unavailable recovery agent. The data of those users who are unable to use their own keys any more would be lost in this case.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.56 Failure of the VoIP architecture", "description": "VoIP can be used as an alternative to a circuit-switching PBX system. All telephone calls, including all incoming, outgoing and internal telephone calls, can be carried out entirely using VoIP. You can use the existing data network or a separately operated data network for the purpose of communication.\nAn IP network consists of active and passive network technology. Passive network technology is primarily understood as the structured cabling system. Active network technology includes hubs, bridges, switches, and routers, for example. The failure of one or more components of the active network technology can lead to the complete standstill of the entire IT network. In such a case, the\nVoIP architecture is also completely unusable when it is operated on the same IT network.\nIf an attacker has direct access to the LAN, for example by connecting a switch or via a wireless network, then the attacker may be able to terminate existing connections under certain circumstances. An example of such a connection is a TCP connection initiated with the Session\nInitiation Protocol (SIP) or H.323, which is terminated using an IP packet with the RST flag set.\nUsing techniques such as flooding, an attacker can overload the data network. However, this does not only apply to VoIP architectures. Practically every stream of information can be disrupted in this manner.\nThe operation of the VoIP architecture generally requires the use of components for switching the telephone calls. Examples of such components are H.323 gatekeepers and SIP registrars. This VoIP middleware can be operated on separate IT systems or on dedicated hardware components. The integration of these devices into the IT network results in new threats not present in circuit-switching PBX systems, which require a separate cable infrastructure. For example, VoIP components can become compromised over the IP network by worms and thus fail.\nTo be able to use VoIP, the users generally need to log in to a corresponding system, for example a registrar when using SIP or a gatekeeper when using H.323. Without appropriate security mechanisms, an attacker could log out a user using forged packets (de-registration). The result of this is that it becomes impossible to reach this user by telephone.\nThe switching units are a particularly attractive target for attack, since the failure of such a system means a large number of users will not be able to make telephone calls any more. For example, if an attacker has physical access to a switching unit, he could manipulate, damage, or simply switch off this central architecture. However, logical attacks to switching units, for example by resetting the network connections or deleting important system files, can also lead to significant damage under certain circumstances.\nThis threat scenario also applies to VoIP end devices. Many tools have been developed for attacking networked IT systems, and the threat scenarios for networked IT systems are also similar to those for VoIP devices. These programs can often also be used by less experienced attackers. By assessing a variety of network parameters such as the responses to certain IP packets, the exact type of the end device can be determined for some devices. This information can then be used to specifically attack these devices.\nThe VoIP end devices as well as the middleware contain a large amount of software. There is therefore a risk that this software contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker. VoIP devices are therefore also susceptible to malware, for example to computer viruses or worms.\nThe availability can also be adversely affected by unpredictable events. Telephones in circuit-switching networks often receive their operating voltage directly from the telephone network. If a PBX system for a circuit-switching network is supplied with power by a local UPS in the event of a power failure, then the end devices will still be able to draw their power from the network. In contrast, VoIP end devices generally do not obtain their power from the IT network.\nEven if the VoIP system is backed up by a UPS, the end devices will be unusable in the event of a power failure. In addition, the failure of the active network technology will also lead to the inoperability of the data network, which means that it will also be impossible to make telephone calls using VoIP.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.57 Interferences relating to the use of VoIP over VPNs", "description": "To make a telephone call using VoIP, both the signalisation information as well as the actual media stream need to be transmitted over a data network. There are protection mechanisms in the protocol level to secure the transport of this data, but they are not supported by all manufacturers and devices. The method used to protect the actual voice communication is generally negotiated by the devices involved. The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) can be used for this purpose, for example.\nIf not all devices support encrypted protocols and telephone calls will be transmitted over insecure networks, then Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can provide this protection. VPNs are used in practice to connect individual employees or to connect an entire network to a public network. When using VPNs, selected packets or all packets are encrypted by a VPN gateway and transmitted to a remote VPN gateway according to a routing table. This gateway decrypts the packets and transmits them to the recipient. Another result of this is that the sender and receiver are located in the same subnetwork even though they may be several hundred kilometres apart.\nUsing VPNs, both the signalisation and media streams for VoIP, as well as all other information such as e-mails, can be protected. Some hardphones support VPNs directly. If an encrypted media transport protocol, for example SRTP, is used, it is sufficient if only the signalisation stream is protected by the VPN.\nThe use of VPNs in connection with VoIP often leads to problems, though.\nIn networks that transmit other information in addition to the VoIP data, VoIP messages are often given priority on the routers and switches. This method is intended to prevent disruptions in the quality such as interruptions or jitter. Even though there is a separate field in the IP header for this purpose in IPv4 (to specify the type of service), this field is seldom used in practice. Instead, the routers prioritise the packets based on their contents. However, when the contents are encrypted, this becomes impossible. As a result, disruptions in the transmission quality can occur more frequently when transmitting VoIP over VPNs when the network load is too high.\nThe use of Hiding NAT (Network Address Translation or Masquerading) can also lead to problems. In contrast to static NAT, not every internal IP address is assigned exactly one public IP address, and it is possible instead for several internal addresses to share one public IP address at the same time.\nTo use this method, the NAT gateway not only has to change the internal IP addresses, but also the port numbers in the IP packets. These changes mean that the checksum generated by the VPN gateway is not correct any more for the new packet. Encrypting all IP communication can also lead to problems.\nThe packets used to transmit VoIP content are usually very small. If the system waits to transmit the packets until a certain number of bytes have been collected, then there may be a large delay in transmission. The actual useful data in the IP packets is generally between 10 and 40 bytes in size.\nIf the IP packets are to be protected by a VPN, then a VPN header must also be taken into account. The additional VPN information represents a significant amount of overhead for small IP packets. The amount of VoIP data increases dramatically as a result of activating the VPN security mechanism. This can lead to overloading of the LAN or of the WAN.\nThe encryption and decryption of the information transmitted also requires resources. If the system performing the encryption or decryption is not designed to handle this task, then a delay in transmission can arise here as well. Such an increase in the response time can lead to interruptions or other problems with the quality.\nMany encryption architectures for VPN use X.509 certificates or pre-shared secrets. For the certificate-based solution in particular, many manufacturers currently use proprietary methods that are incompatible with each other. If VoIP connections to external partners are to be established, you will either not be able to call these partners using these solutions or the calls will not be encrypted.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.58 Vulnerabilities relating to the use of VoIP end devices", "description": "There are two different types of VoIP end devices: hardphones and softphones. Hardphones are stand-alone devices that usually run proprietary operating systems and are connected directly to the IP network. Some hardphones load their current configuration using the TFTP protocol.\nSoftphones are application programs whose functionality matches that of hardphones and which are installed on a computer. To access the IP network, a softphone uses an interface on the computer that it shares with other installed applications.\nFor the most part, all VoIP end devices offer similar functions that can be impaired by programs intending to cause damage. In this case, the threats range from partial impairment of normal operations to the ability of the attacker to take complete control over the device.\nIf the security precautions taken are poor, malware such as Trojan horses can spread throughout the system. Trojan horses can be used on a VoIP network to transmit private information of a subscriber or the contents of a conversion held during the telephone call to an attacker, for example.\nMalicious software may also attempt to make calls without the user knowing it, or to find and transmit information on the telephone calls made or private telephone numbers from the address book.\nWhen a call is initiated by a user, devices establish the connection according to the settings in the configuration and the telephone number selected. Manipulations to the configuration or firmware of the device can lead to the disruption of the dialling process or even to redirecting the call through the infrastructure of the attacker. In this manner, the attacker may also be able to listen in on the next telephone call under certain circumstances.\nWhen the caller terminates the call, an infected device could simulate the signal designating the end of the call while maintaining the connection in the background. This connection could then be used to listen in on the user. If a device is infected by malware, the malware could also suppress the signals of incoming calls without the person being called even noticing this. The result is that this user can no longer be called by telephone.\nAnother potential type of attack using malware is to secretly activate the microphone of a VoIP end device to record the conversations in the room and transmit them to the attacker via VoIP. The amount of time and effort required to program a corresponding malware program with such functionality is relatively low since the VoIP functionality needed (codecs, VoIP protocols) is already implemented on the end devices and can be used by the malware.\nThe degree to which the described risks actually threaten a device depends on several factors, for example the type and settings of the operating system, whether or not resources are shared with other applications (for example in the case of softphones), and the protection mechanisms implemented.\nIn general, it can be said that softphones are more susceptible to attacks from programs intended to cause damage than hardphones, because softphones are usually based on widely used operating systems and share resources with other applications installed (which may have their own security gaps). In contrast, hardphones have their own, separate network interface and are usually based on proprietary operating systems whose settings have been customised to provide the required functionality. For this reason, they can generally only be attacked by malware programs that have been specially developed for precisely these operating systems.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.59 Non-accessibility of VoIP due to NAT", "description": "In the Internet, a computer can be uniquely identified by means of its IP address. In Internet\nProtocol version 4 (IPv4), which is currently the version most often used, the IP address is composed of four numbers between 0 and 255, for example 194.95.176.226. In the newer Internet\nProtocol version 6 (IPv6), an IP address consists of eight four-digit hexadecimal numbers, for example FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210. The main disadvantage of version 4 when compared to version 6 (which has not prevailed yet) is the low number of public IP addresses available in the address space. Only very few organisations are able to obtain enough IP addresses to assign every workstation computer its own static IP address. This problem can be eliminated using Network Address Translation (NAT). In this case, only the system located between the public network and the private network needs one (or just a few) public IP address(es). The actual workstation computers are assigned internal IP addresses, and when a packet is forwarded by one of the active network components (usually a NAT gateway), the internal IP address is converted into an external IP address.\nA new UDP or TCP connection needs to be opened for the media stream, which is needed to transmit the voice information. The IP addresses and port numbers required for this purpose are transmitted in the signalling information. NAT modifies the source IP address in the IP header and the source port number in the UDP or TCP header of the media stream. The specifications for the source IP address and port number in the message section of the signalling information remain unchanged.\nAs a result, media streams cannot be sent to a VoIP telephone located behind a NAT gateway. VoIP devices located in the Internet cannot send any media streams to a VoIP telephone located behind a NAT gateway, since the private IP address is not routed in the Internet. Voice communication with VoIP devices located behind a NAT gateway because the configuration is critical and needs to be secured is therefore impossible even when there are no errors in signalling.\nProtocols such as IAX (InterAsterisk eXchange) or Skype are exceptions. In these protocols, signalling as well as the media transport is performed using an existing connection. Since no additional connections to the computers in the private network need to be established, the problems with NAT described above are eliminated when using one of these protocols. However, since no more checks are performed on the network gateway when these protocols are used, other security problems can arise.\nTo enable VoIP communication via a NAT gateway, the media stream of the NAT gateway can be forwarded statically to the VoIP devices. This potential solution is often encountered on private customer connections to SIP providers. However, this can lead to problems. In this case, the sender located outside of the LAN establishes a connection to the NAT gateway using a reserved port number. The NAT gateway transfers this connection to the end device assigned to this port number. This approach assumes that the devices participating in the connection know the reserved port numbers. A more serious disadvantage, though, is that the forwarded ports of the VoIP system behind the NAT gateway can be accessed from the public data network.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.60 Uncontrolled radio wave propagation", "description": "Wireless networks and the radio waves emitted often radiate beyond the limits of the rooms the networks are used in, and so it is possible for data to be transmitted to areas which cannot be controlled and secured by the users or the organisation. It is therefore possible to record the data with minimal effort, and this type of eavesdropping is only detected in a small fraction of all cases. The goal of such attacks may be to obtain or manipulate sensitive information. Due to the inadequate protection of many wireless networks, it is often enough just to record and analyse the wireless communications over a period of time even if the data is transmitted in encrypted form because the cryptographic key can be calculated afterwards using the data collected, and the transmitted data can then be decoded. Furthermore, directional antennas can be used to receive and capture data from the wireless network outside the limits of the network's specified range.\n", "examples": "A laptop with a WLAN card, together with a few freely available WLAN applications, is all that is required to search for poorly secured WLANs. When wardriving, for example, people drive around a certain region, a city district, or a typical office environment with a WLAN client and record where and which WLANs are broadcasting and how poorly secured they are. In this case, the data can also be linked directly with GPS data to determine the geographic location of the WLANs found. Afterwards, poorly secured WLANs are targeted specifically, for example to gain free access to the Internet.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.61 Unreliable or missing WLAN security mechanisms", "description": "In their delivered configurations, WLAN components are often configured so that only a few security mechanisms are activated, or possibly none at all. Some of these mechanisms are also unreliable and do not offer adequate protection. Even today, there are various WLAN components in use and available as new devices on the market that only support inadequate security mechanisms such as WEP. In some cases, these devices cannot even be updated to obtain stronger security mechanisms.\nIf no or only weak mechanisms are available to adequately secure the wireless interface and the services used over the WLAN, then secure communication is impossible in the WLAN. This poses additional threats to all components linked together in the network, including, for example, all data also stored on a WLAN client or in a LAN, which can adversely affect the entire IT infrastructure of a government agency or company. In the following, examples of possible security problems are listed.\nWEP\nIf the wireless communication in the WLAN is not protected at all or only protected with WEP, then an attacker can easily listen in on all WLAN communication and often gain possession of confidential information. When using some devices such as WLAN-enabled printers, users are often unaware that a WLAN connection is established in this case, and the network is therefore inadequately secured. An attacker, though, may not only be able to listen in on the printed data, but may also be able to access components in the background system through the WLAN components.\nSSID Broadcast\nWhen transmitting data between two neighbouring wireless cells, the SSID (Service Set Identifier or network name) is used to find the next access point. Some access points offer capabilities for suppressing the transmission of the SSID in the broadcast mode to hide the WLAN from unauthorised persons (referred to as a \"closed system\"). However, WLAN analysers can be used in this case as well to determine the SSID using other management and control signals.\nAbility to manipulate MAC addresses\nEvery network card has its own unique hardware address referred to as the MAC address (Media\nAccess Control address). The MAC addresses of the WLAN clients can be easily intercepted and manipulated, meaning the MAC address filters often built into the access points for the purpose of access protection can be easily overcome.\nNo key management\nCryptographic keys must be distributed manually in many WLANs, i.e. the same static key must be entered in every WLAN client and access point. This requires physical access to the components. This type of key management often leads to the following situation in actual practice: the cryptographic keys are very seldom changed or not changed at all. If a WLAN key is disclosed, then the entire WLAN is compromised in this case.\nVulnerabilities during administrative accesses to access points\nMany access points offer different interfaces and protocols for administration purposes and permit their use over the LAN interface as well as over the wireless interface. When administration is performed over the wireless interface using plain text protocols such as Telnet, HTTP, or SNMP, the administration passwords transmitted over the WLAN can be intercepted. Attackers could use this information to reconfigure the access point.\nEncrypted versions of the access protocols mentioned are often not supported or their use is not enforced on the access points.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.62 Use of inadequate power outlet strips", "description": "There are usually not enough fixed electrical outlets installed to operate all equipment required.\nPower strips are then usually used to compensate for the lack of outlets. Such power outlet strips, when of insufficient quality, are a dangerous ignition source due to * poor contacts\n* contact springs that are too weak * a lack of strain relief\n* use of wires with conductors that are too small * overvoltages and are therefore a significant fire hazard.\nWhen several small power strips are connected in series to provide enough outlets for all equipment, the risks due to small conductors and overvoltages increases even more.\nIf the power strips are placed on the floor in a workspace, then they are also often subject to mechanical stress due to being kicked or stepped on, or bumped into by vacuum cleaners, etc. Due to the lack of stress relief and poor contacts, this can quickly lead to contact resistances, overheating, and finally to a fire. Furthermore, power strips are a tripping hazard when simply placed loosely on the floor.\n", "examples": "In a branch office of an insurance company, a smouldering fire started due to a defective power strip purchased privately by an employee.

Since some of this dust settles on the fans, considerable quantities of dust build up on the fans over time. The dust build-ups can\n* reduce the air flow, and therefore the cooling effect, of the fan so much that the devices overheat and fail or catch fire (primarily in power supplies).\n* slow or completely stop the fan from rotating, which then causes the blocked fan motor to overheat and itself become an ignition source.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.64 Complexity of printers, copiers, and all-in-one devices", "description": "Nowadays, network printers, high-performance copiers and all-in-one devices are complex IT systems. They not only offer a wide range of equipment and an expanded range of functions, but they can also introduce new risks to other IT systems or the LAN.\nLocal administration interfaces\nOn some printers and all-in-one devices, access to the administration interface cannot be secured, meaning it cannot be protected against unauthorised access using a password query. With administrator rights, an attacker could manipulate the printer so that it does not accept any print jobs or writes all print jobs received to an internal memory for viewing at a later time, for example.\nAdministration via LAN\nNetwork printers and all-in-one devices can generally be administered over the local network as well. If access protection is impossible or was not set up, then the data in the printer could be read out or manipulated due to the lack of access protection. In some cases, this is not only possible from workstations on the local network, but also from the Internet. Some printers even have a Java engine that permits the installation and execution of any Java program as well as Java configuration applets on the printer. In addition to the ability to manipulate printer settings and print jobs, this also provides a wide range of attack possibilities on a local network that can be carried out over a printer.\nIntegrated web servers\nMany network printers and high-performance copiers now have built-in web servers intended to make administration easier. Ease-of-use in this case comes at the cost of additional risks. For example, printers with integrated web servers were forced to crash in the past due to a side-effect of a worm attack (\"Code Red\") even though they were not affected by the actual attack of the worm. Some manufacturers do not offer any possibility of securing web access to the printer administration and restrict access to authorized persons only, for example. The web interface is often neglected during configuration so that internal or even external persons are able to manipulate the printer configuration and usage, depending on how it is connected to the existing network. For example, any user of the printer could accidentally or intentionally delete other people's print jobs or adversely affect the availability of the printer. Some web servers in printers also return diagnostic data when an excessively long URL is entered. This data can then be the basis for the development of attack programs.\nUnencrypted communication with the administration\nHTTP(S), Telnet or SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) are often used as the protocols for configuration.\nIn case of access via HTTP or Telnet, information is not protected during transmission. In this case, an attacker could listen in on the communication and therefore read the password for configuration. This password could then be used for a number of attacks on the confidentiality, availability, and integrity if no other safeguards are implemented.\nIn addition to configuration by the administrator, user access to the web servers on printers is also often desired. The users could then, for example, cancel their print jobs or check if the printer is processing any other print jobs at the time. However, the users will also be able to see what kinds of documents other employees are printing out. Usually, the file name of the document to be printed can be seen, for example \"Application_CompanyNextDoor.doc\". If an attacker is able to read the passwords of the other users transmitted in plain text, then the attacker could view or cancel the print jobs of other users or redirect the printout to another printer. Users usually repeat the print operation until the document is printed out on their favoured printer. In this case, documents from sensitive areas can get into the hands of unauthorised persons without being noticed.\nSpecial printer services and usage environments\nVarious manufacturers have implemented an address book function into their network printers for integrated sending of e-mails or faxes. When such functions are used, it is difficult to ensure that data will not be passed on to unauthorised persons via the printer and onto the Internet, for example.\nMany printers can also be controlled via ftp and with anonymous access via LDAP. This could be used by any user in the local network to manipulate the printer. Some manufacturers even offer free additional software over the Internet that can be used to bypass, for the most part, the password assigned for printer configuration. In most cases, access to the configuration of the printer is not restricted after delivery by the manufacturer. In some operating systems, network printers can be configured using a domain assignment in addition to configuration via LDAP. In this case there is a risk that unauthorised persons on LAN servers could obtain administrator rights for the printer.\nFor some purposes, it may make sense to connect the printer over a wireless network or to use wireless printers directly. Wireless transmissions of this type also need to be protected appropriately against eavesdropping, falsification of data, manipulation of the printer configuration, disruption of the connections and other security problems.\nSoftware errors\nErrors in the implementation of printer drivers can also affect the security of a workstation computer. Security vulnerabilities have been found that made it possible for users with normal user rights to gain administrator rights due to a faulty printer driver.\nThe lpd printer daemon often used in Unix is sensitive to buffer overflows in several versions. This makes it possible, for example, to initiate denial of service attacks or to start program code with root rights from remote computers. Another hazardous function in Windows ME was the automatic installation of all shared printers in the network. In this case, files were automatically transferred from external printers and operating systems and then installed on the computer running\nWindows ME. It was therefore easy to attack the operating system by executing VXD files.\n", "examples": "* An attacker redirects a certain printout to a printer that the user normally does not use. In this manner, the attacker can also view documents with a higher protection level in terms of their confidentiality. The user cannot find the desired printout on the printer and assumes there are technical problems. Without even thinking that an attack could be the reason, the user generates a new printout, which he then picks up from his normal printer.\n* The \"Bugbear\" worm has been known of since the end of September 2002. It spreads through e-mails and network shares. A possible side-effect of \"Bugbear\" is that print jobs with nonsensical contents are automatically sent to all shared network printers and are then sometimes also printed. The results are, among others, blocked printers or a waste of consumables.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.65 Inadequate protection of communication for printers and all-in-one devices", "description": "Unencrypted printer communication\nNetwork printers are not usually controlled locally, but are controlled instead over a network connection. To control the printer, the printer driver of the corresponding local computer sends all information required directly to the printer or to a central printer server, which then transmits the information to the printer. These data transmissions are rarely encrypted.\nNo network separation\nSecurity gateways between a LAN and the Internet are often configured in such a way that Internet access is enabled for entire subnets. At the same time, network printers are often assigned to the same subnet as the workstation PCs that print documents on these devices. This means it is also possible for the network printer to access the Internet. If the connections from the Internet to the printers are not rejected by the security gateways, sensitive information can be taken from the network without permission under some circumstances. The spectrum of information transmitted can range from error messages to statistics to entire documents. Detailed user profiles can even be created from the transmitted error messages and statistics. For example, the IP addresses can be used to determine the network structure.\nSome manufacturers now send data for statistical and maintenance purposes directly from the printer to a server of the manufacturer. This is often not documented, and it may be impossible to determine what data were transmitted to the manufacturer.\nIn addition to the unwanted flow of information out of the LAN, a network-capable printer can also receive unwanted data from the Internet and possibly distribute this information. An example of this is malware that not only restricts the functionality of the device, but also infects other IT systems in the network. Malware may have entered the system from the Internet via compromised patches, for example. A network printer can therefore become an opening for attacks from the Internet under certain circumstances.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.66 Impairment of health and environment due to printers, copiers, and all-in-one devices", "description": "Although a large amount of information is stored digitally, paper documents are still often indispensable. Many people prefer to read or edit documents on paper rather than on the screen.\nPrinters and copiers will therefore remain an indispensable resource for a long time to come. Their use, however, may cause damage to health.\nLaser printers and copiers usually use a dry toner that is transferred to the paper. The dust-like toner also contains heavy metals such as lead and cadmium in addition to the actual pigment. This toner dust is not transferred completely to the paper so that residual toner may become distributed throughout the entire room. Toner can also escape when replacing a nearly empty toner cartridge with a full one. In this case, the fine toner dust, which is hazardous to health, can be breathed in and deposited in the lungs. In addition, some devices release ozone when operated. Modern devices are equipped with filters, however, that reduce the amount of ozone emitted.\nCentral printers, copiers, and all-in-one devices are often used and accessed by a large group of users. These devices often operate at high capacity. Although the noise generated during the operation of modern devices will not cause hearing damage, it is rarely possible to work efficiently anywhere near the device.

One possible result is that it may be temporarily impossible to access the data stored in the directory. In extreme cases, it can even lead to losses of data, which can in turn impair business processes and internal workflows. If functioning copies of the system that has failed are available, then it will still be possible to gain access, but the access performance may be limited under certain circumstances depending on the network topology selected.\nA technical defect in a central cryptographic module can have a significant impact on the operability of a directory service if it then becomes impossible to access the directory service components any more. The cryptographic keys, for example those needed to secure a data transmission route for a directory service, could have been deleted, especially if they were only stored in volatile memory. The result is that it will be temporarily impossible to guarantee confidentiality. This is especially critical if the failure is not noticed and encryption cannot be executed any more due to the malfunction even though the operator of the directory service bases its guarantee of the confidentiality of the data on the cryptographic module. It may be impossible to encrypt data while the cryptographic module needed is unavailable, which could then lead to availability problems for the directory service or additional applications that process the decrypted data.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.68 Disruptions in an Active Directory due to unnecessary file replication", "description": "Since the introduction of the Windows 2000 Server operating system, the domain controllers have been using the File Replication Service (FRS) to replicate system policies and login scripts of the clients in the network of an organisation.\nFurthermore, FRS is also used to replicate the data of fault-tolerant shares in the Distributed File\nSystem (DFS) between servers running Windows 2000 Server and higher versions.\nThe FRS service monitors \"File Close\" events of the NTFS file system for all directories and files to be replicated via FRS so it can trigger replication at a suitable time. \"File Close\" events are triggered in this case by certain file operations such as operations that delete or create files or make changes to the file and directory authorisations.\nSoftware used for system administration such as backup programs or virus protection programs that access files and directories monitored by the FRS service can trigger an unnecessary replication if they access the files and directories improperly. All files pending for replication are collected in a folder referred to as the staging folder before actually performing replication.\nThe following are possible signs of an unnecessary replication in the system environment:\n* Files from DFS shares are frequently replicated even though no detectable changes have been made to the files.\n* Replication between the replication partners in the network consumes too much bandwidth.\n* The number of the files in the staging folder increases constantly. If the number of files always increases when a virus scanner or backup program is executing, for example, then this is a clear sign of unnecessary replication. In many cases, the staging folder will be empty again in the next replication cycle of the FRS after the execution of the virus protection program or backup program has been completed.\nIf the staging folder is never completely empty, then this indicates that replication cannot be performed completely due to the large number of files that have been modified.\n", "examples": "In one organisation, a virus protection program is used that triggers the \"File Close\" event every time a file is accessed due to errors in its implementation. The organisation's computer virus protection concept specifies that the virus scanning program used must be started on the servers to perform a full scan of all files at regular intervals.\nThe incorrect handling of the \"File Close\" event triggers replication for every file, which then simultaneously triggers an unintended, full synchronisation of all files and directories between the servers and domain controllers in the organisation.\nThe data traffic resulting from synchronisation can restrict proper access to the resources in an organisation to such an extent that it becomes impossible to guarantee proper operation. This applies especially to the branch offices of an organisation that are connected to the headquarters by connections with a relatively low bandwidth.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.69 Problems with the IPSec configuration", "description": "Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is a widely used method for securing IP-based communication and is often used for VPNs. IPSec can be understood as a series of protocols for key management, authentication, and encryption. Due to the complexity of the standard, it is possible to configure\nIPSec incorrectly, which then threatens the security and stability of the communication connections, for example of the VPN channel.\nBefore actually performing encryption, the communication partners need to agree to the security associations (SAs) to be used. In many IPSec implementations, there is an option for working with fixed SAs and keys. However, their use comes in conjunction with the disadvantages described in T 2.130 Inappropriate selection of VPN authentication methods.\nIf the aggressive mode is selected for key negotiation (a mode for establishing connections faster), then the identities and signatures (as well as optional certificates) are transmitted as plain text.\nSince the IPSec standard was specified in 1998, it does not take some of the methods for network configuration developed later into account. For example, in certain configurations, IPSec has traffic-related problems with the Network Address Translation (NAT) used nowadays in many networks because it changes the IPSec packets. For this reason, the supplemental RFCs 3947 and\n3948 were developed with regard to the issue of NAT traversal.\nMany manufacturers of VPN software have also implemented one or more versions of solutions to the NAT problem in their products that are mutually incompatible in some cases. When NAT is used, this means that different VPN products may only be able to communicate with each other at a lower security level, with limitations, or they may not even be able to communicate at all.\nThe most common configuration problems with an IPSec VPN are due to the SA suggestion lists.\nProblems arise when none of the SA suggestions of the initiator matches a suggestion provided by the other end, i.e. by the responder. Another frequently encountered reason for the inability to establish an IPSec connection is when not enough ports are activated on the security gateways.\n", "examples": "* An administrator configured the aggressive mode due to its ability to establish connections faster. The transmission of plain text in the aggressive mode has a flaw, though: the gateway sends a hash value derived using the pre-shared keying (PSK) method for authentication over the network. Since this hash value is not encrypted, an attacker could reconstruct the key using a dictionary or brute force attack and gain access to the corporate network.\n* During the initial installation of the VPN of a medium-sized company, an inexperienced administrator transmitted the key used in an unencrypted e-mail to the corresponding branch office, and someone eavesdropped on the transmission. The attacker could then dial into the VPN with the help of the information obtained, access confidential documents, and then sell them to a competitor.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.70 Insecure default settings on VPN components", "description": "The standard settings of VPN components do not always exhibit the characteristics of a secure installation. In many cases, the manufacturers pay more attention to user-friendliness and problem-free integration into existing systems than to security. Poor adaptation to the actual security requirements can thus lead to avoidable vulnerabilities, and therefore expose critical points of attack.\nSince the encryption of a VPN channel, when used correctly, can only be cracked after expending considerable effort, the VPN end points are a simple starting point for breaking in to a network. To prepare for an attack, an attacker would first obtain all information available on the VPN. There are special tools available in the Internet that make it easier to perform such analyses.\n", "examples": "* A newly purchased VPN gateway was integrated into the internal network of one company by the administrator. Since it immediately provided its services after booting using the default settings, the administrator did not change any of the default settings. However, the product also permitted remote administration by default, and the default password for remote administration was well known. Because so many users already knew the default password, its use threatened the secure operation of the internal site network.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.71 Problems when automating the distribution of patches and changes", "description": "Frequently, patches and changes are not distributed manually, but supported by software in a centralised manner. Using software-supported tools within the framework of patch and change management has some advantages, but also disadvantages. For complex IT structures of an organisation, individual errors occurring while patching the IT systems may entail a great deal of security problems. This is particularly severe if software characterised by security gaps is installed simultaneously on many systems.\nIf errors only occur occasionally, they can often be remedied manually. However, problems arise if the IT system is permanently unavailable in the LAN. An example includes field representatives only rarely or irregularly connecting their computers to the LAN. For example, if the tool is configured in such a way that the updates are only distributed within a certain period of time and if not all IT systems are available, these IT systems cannot be updated.\n", "examples": "In a company, more stringent packet filter rules were installed on the security gateways (firewalls).

There were problems in some older versions of the ReiserFS file system when it was used in connection with Samba.\nIf it is not ensured during installation that the operating system/file system combination used is suitable for the TDB files of Samba, serious performance issues or malfunctions may occur due to inconsistencies in the databases.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.73 Impaired software functionality due to compatibility problems with Windows Vista and Windows 7", "description": "Software that could be operated successfully on previous versions of an operating system will not necessarily work with the current version of the operating system.

The infrastructure components (network components, storage networks, and the like) required for operating the server systems are also distributed to different physical IT systems.\nIn a virtualised environment, however, the server systems and parts of the required infrastructure components are largely provided by the virtualisation servers as stand-alone server instances.\nTherefore, if a virtual server accesses the network, for example, it does not access a physical IT system such as a switch, but a component provided by the virtualisation server that is only operated as software, but not as stand-alone hardware.\nIf a physical IT system fails, it is often possible to continue to work with the remainder of the systems. The services provided by the failed server cannot be used any longer, but this does not necessarily affect all other installed servers. For example, if a database server failed, access to the file server may still be possible. Therefore, this does not affect the entirety of business processes supported by the information system.\nIn contrast, numerous and various instances of virtualised IT systems (guests) are normally consolidated technically on a few physical machines in a virtualised IT infrastructure. This significantly increases the effects on the availability in the event of malfunctions of a virtualisation server. If physical components of a virtualisation server are damaged or if there is a malfunction regarding its operating system, all virtual IT systems running on that server will be affected.\nIf an IT system fails, the data processed by this system may be damaged. The time and expense required to re-commission the system may be higher, since data recovery from the data backup may be required. Data may also have been lost irretrievably. If several virtual IT systems fail simultaneously due to an error of a virtualisation server, this increases the likelihood of at least one of the failed systems suffering such damage. Therefore, such a case may result in a longer interruption of operations when compared to the failure of only one IT system.\nMany services depend on each other in computer centre operations. For example, an email system requires a directory service in order to assign the recipient addresses to the mailboxes. A task management system requires the email system in order to process incoming and outgoing tasks.\nFurthermore, the system automatically creates tasks using the ERP system in order to support the processing of the customers' orders. Moreover, the ERP system accesses the warehouse management database in order to monitor the stocks.\nThe failure of individual components of the information system may cause the partial failure of services provided in the computer centre. If several IT systems are operated as virtual IT systems on one virtualisation server, several components of an information system fail simultaneously with the virtualisation server. This may result in stronger adverse effects on IT operations when compared to classic, non-virtualised computer centre operations.\n", "examples": "A medium-sized company decided to use a virtualisation solution. It was planned to procure several very powerful servers and to significantly reduce the number of physical systems.\nOn the virtualisation servers, IT systems and their services were distributed according to aspects such as processor load and memory consumption. In doing so, it was considered how the virtual IT systems could be optimally distributed to the virtualisation servers.\nThe company uses an email system based on a directory service. Additionally, an accounting system distributed to an application server and a database server is operated. The ERP and warehousing systems used additionally also use the accounting database for exchanging data.\nSince the database server of the accounting system and the email server belong to the IT systems with the highest performance requirements, it was decided to operate these on separate virtualisation servers. This is performed in order to prevent any mutual interference of the systems during operation. The in-depth analysis of the systems' performance requirements showed that an optimal consolidation effect can be achieved if the virtual IT systems are distributed as follows:\nFirst virtualisation server: database, directory service\nSecond virtualisation server: email system, accounting system\nThird virtualisation server: ERP system, warehousing system\nThe first virtualisation server failed due to a damaged electrolyte capacitor on the mainboard of this server. This server contained the database for the accounting system and the directory service of the company separated in virtual machines.\nThe failure of this physical server had wide-ranging consequences for IT operations as a whole. The application servers of the accounting department, as well as the warehouse and logistics and enterprise resource planning departments are located on other virtualisation servers, but they depend on a data exchange with the database in order to work properly. Central processes failed completely in the company so that the delivery of customers' orders stopped and a loss of production with a duration of several hours had to be accepted as a consequence of the failure of the ERP and warehousing system.\nFurthermore, it was not possible to immediately inform the customers of the company of the loss of production via email, since the email system failed as well. This way, the company violated essential duties of its supply agreements and had to bear contractual penalties in addition to the costs incurred as a consequence of the loss of production.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.75 Failure of the network infrastructure of virtualisation environments", "description": "Several virtualisation servers can be consolidated to form a so-called virtual infrastructure. In such a virtual infrastructure, the virtual IT systems can be distributed to the individual virtualisation servers as required. Furthermore, it is possible to migrate the virtual machines between the virtualisation servers. For some products, this may also be performed while the virtual IT system is being executed (examples: Microsoft Hyper-V Live Migration, VMware VMotion, XEN LiveMigration). Such a process, hereinafter referred to as Live Migration, is normally transparent for the virtual IT system, i.e. it does not notice the migration process. Many further functions of a virtual infrastructure build upon this migration technology. These include functions such as the dynamic assignment of processor and main memory resources. Here, the virtual IT system is always migrated to the virtualisation server that is able to optimally provide the required resources. This way, a virtual IT system is always provided with the best possible assignment of resources.\nFurthermore, there are virtualisation products compensating the failure of a virtualisation server by automatically restarting the virtual IT systems also affected by the failure on another virtualisation server.\nIn order to implement the described technical possibilities, a communication network is required between the virtualisation servers involved in order to coordinate these functions (automatic restart, Live Migration). If failures occur in this network, the functions coordinated with the help of this network will fail as well.\nA failure in the communication between virtualisation servers may cause a Live Migration to be cancelled. This could cause the failure of mechanisms for dynamic load balancing if a virtual machine is to be migrated to a different destination server due to a resource bottleneck As a consequence, the resource bottleneck on the source server that cannot be eliminated results in a limited availability of the non-migratable IT system.\nIn order to increase the availability of virtual IT systems, several virtualisation servers can be connected to form a cluster. The systems participating in such a server cluster require smooth communication amongst each other. The systems use this communication for mutual monitoring and for checking whether the virtual IT systems running on their partners are still available\n(Heartbeat), for example. If one of the partners in the cluster fails, the IT systems which also failed are restarted on a different virtualisation server, as far as possible.\nIf the communication network of the cluster fails, for example, due to a hardware error on a switch, the failure compensation function of the cluster is out of order. The virtual IT systems on the virtualisation servers, which are also members of the cluster, may also be endangered regarding their availability.\nFor the rest, the communication network between the systems participating in the high-availability cluster assumes additional important functions along with the functions mentioned above: If the communication between several systems of a cluster fails simultaneously, every system must be able to decide whether it or the other systems are affected by the failure (isolation problem). If two or more virtualisation servers participating in a high-availability cluster started a virtual IT system separately several times, the data representing this virtual system could be damaged. This may render the virtual IT system useless. There may also be failures if one and the same IT system exists several times in the network (e.g. by duplicate IP or MAC addresses).\nConnection of storage networks\nVirtual IT systems are normally represented physically by a host of files. Along with the configuration of the virtual IT system, these files also contain the containers for virtual hard disks, for example. If snapshots of the virtual IT systems are created in any, even running operating condition, the virtualisation server also stores the data thus produced in files. These files may either be stored to the virtualisation server itself or in the related central storage network.\nVirtual server environments consisting of several virtualisation servers are often connected to central storage networks so that access to the files representing the virtual IT systems is possible from several locations. If the connection to these storage resources is interrupted, this effects the virtual IT systems as if the hard disk was removed from a physical server during live operations.\nSince frequently more than one virtual IT system is stored to storage resources in a storage network, the operational reliability of many virtual IT systems is endangered in the event of a failure. A failure may cause file system inconsistencies in the virtual IT systems and virtualisation servers affected by the failure that may require comprehensive recovery measures.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.76 Failure of administration servers for virtualisation systems", "description": "Several virtualisation servers may be used in order to design a virtual infrastructure. For this, the virtualisation servers are connected in such a way that the virtual IT systems running on them are always executed on the virtualisation server that is able to provide the optimal performance for the respective IT system. If a virtualisation server is able to provide a running virtual IT system with more resources (dynamic assignment of resources, e.g. Citrix XenServer Workload Balancing or\nVMware Dynamic Resource Scheduling), it is even possible to migrate this IT system to the IT system with the available resources with the help of a migration (Live Migration).\nAdditionally, the availability of the virtual IT systems can be increased by high-availability mechanisms such as the automatic restart of failed virtual machines. These functions require a central administration server for the majority of the virtualisation products coordinating the operation of the individual virtual machines and the virtualisation servers. Virtualisation products capable of using such a central administration server include Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V, or VMware ESX, for example The administration server (Citrix XenCenter, Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager, SUN Management Center, or Vmware vCenter) is normally also equipped with a monitoring component that can be used to monitor the function of the virtual IT systems and the virtualisation servers.\nSince the administration server controls and administrates all functions of a virtual infrastructure, a failure of this administration system results in the loss of the capability of performing any configuration changes to the virtual infrastructure. During this period, the administrators cannot react to occurring problems such as resource bottlenecks or the failure of individual virtualisation servers, nor can they integrate a new virtualisation server into the infrastructure and/or create new virtual IT systems.\nFunctions such as Live Migration and therefore the dynamic assignment of resources for individual guest systems are no longer available either, since the instance coordinating such functions is no longer operational. As a consequence, the virtual infrastructure is no longer able to automatically react to resource bottlenecks which has adverse effects on both the performance and the availability of individual virtual IT systems. This is particularly applicable if the resources of the virtualisation servers have been overbooked.\nAdditionally, the administration server serves for monitoring the virtualisation servers and the virtual IT systems operated on these servers. If the administration server or its monitoring component provides incorrect data or no data at all, the administrators are no longer capable of appropriately monitoring the functionality of the virtual infrastructure. Thus, there is the risk that resource bottlenecks in the virtual infrastructure remain unnoticed and an expansion of the virtual infrastructure is provided too late. It may also be possible that the failure of individual virtual IT systems is noticed too late if the monitoring function of the virtual infrastructure failed.\nFurthermore, the failure of virtualisation servers may even remain unnoticed if the IT systems running on this server have been migrated to another virtualisation server and therefore no services fail in the computer centre, but the failure is not indicated due to an error in the administration and monitoring software. The related reduction of redundancy may massively reduce the overall availability of the virtual infrastructure.\n", "examples": "* An organisation operates several virtualisation servers consolidated in two farms. In each these farms, several virtual IT systems are operated. The virtualisation servers were distributed to two farms, since certain virtual IT systems must not be operated together with other IT systems due to different protection requirements.\nDuring the planning phase of the two farms, the number of virtualisation servers required in each case was determined based on a forecast of the future performance requirements. After a while, the forecast turns out to be incorrect. It is determined that an additional virtualisation server is required in the first of the two farms in order to cover the performance requirements of the virtual IT systems.\nAfter having analysed the performance data of the second farm, the administrators of the virtualisation servers determine that the utilisation of these serves is far lower than predicted in the performance forecast. Therefore, it is decided to not to procure a new virtualisation server, but to migrate one virtualisation server from the second farm to the first one.\nNow, the virtual IT systems on the virtualisation server to be migrated to the first farm are migrated to other systems and the server is added to the first farm. As a consequence, the resources of the second farm are massively overbooked This was not to be expected according to the results of the performance analysis.\nThe reason for the massive losses in performance of the virtual IT systems in the second farm was that the administration system for this farm incorrectly processed the performance data of the individual virtualisation servers and indicated values for resource consumption that were significantly lower than they should have been.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.77 Resource bottlenecks due to improperly functioning guest tools in virtual environments", "description": "For many virtualisation products, so-called guest tools can be installed in the virtual IT systems. On the one hand, these tools serve for providing specific, optimised device drivers for the virtual hardware components of a virtual machine. On the other hand, the virtualisation server may use these guest tools to control the resource consumption of a virtual IT system for certain products. This is particularly necessary if the virtualisation product used allows overbooking of resources such as internal memory or hard disk space. For example, if two virtual IT systems compete for internal memory capacity, the host operating system or a hypervisor may order the guest tools to reserve virtual RAM and therefore its physical equivalent in one of the virtual IT systems. The physical representation of this storage is not used by the virtual IT system now and is controlled by the hypervisor using the guest tools. The hypervisor may now provide this physical storage to the other virtual IT system as virtual RAM. The other way around, a virtual IT system may use the guest tools to request main memory capacity. Such a technology is used in the ESX product of the manufacturer VMware, for example. Here, the storage is reserved with the help of a so-called Ballooning driver. This driver is included in the guest tools (VMware Tools).\nFurthermore, the device drivers of the guest tools may be used to restrict resource access for some virtualisation products. For example, it is possible to restrict the bandwidth a virtual IT system uses to access the network or the storage network.\nTherefore, programming errors in the guest tools may have wide-ranging consequences for the operation of the affected virtual IT systems due to their manifold functions, since numerous IT systems are affected simultaneously in the majority of the cases.\nDevice drivers\nThe most common operational purpose of the guest tools is to provide optimised device drivers for the emulated hardware (graphics card, network card, bulk memory) of the virtual IT systems provided by the virtualisation server. The emulated hardware may also be used by the virtual IT system with the help of the drivers included in the scope of delivery of the most commonly used operating system, but optimal use is only possible with the help of specifically adapted drivers. Since these drivers are normally also used in all virtual IT systems, an error in these drivers affects all virtual machines.\nOverbooking of storage resources\nIf the main memory of the virtualisation server is overbooked and if storage requests within a virtual IT system are processed improperly by the guest tools, it may happen that processes are not provided with enough storage capacity.\nErrors in bandwidth management\nIf the bandwidth management functions in the guest tools were programmed incorrectly, the guidelines defined for these may be ineffective. However, a virtual IT system may also be provided with far too little or no bandwidth at all.\nFor example, if a virtual system consistently causes high levels of network traffic and heavily utilises the physically existing resources, the connections of other virtual IT systems may be affected adversely so that connections of these IT systems are interrupted as a consequence, endangering their availability.\nThe administrator of the virtualisation server could now use the guest tools to either restrict the available bandwidth of the first virtual IT system or guarantee a certain minimum bandwidth for the other systems. If the bandwidth control guidelines have become ineffective due to a programming error, for example after updating the guest tools, the objectives pursued by these guidelines are not attained. The availability of the systems therefore continues to be limited.\nIf, despite proper guidelines, the error in the guest tools results in there being too low a bandwidth for the first IT system in the scenario described, the availability of this system may be limited, since it cannot use the required bandwidth to access the network. The same holds true for all other IT systems, the communication of which should be protected.\n", "examples": "A medium-sized company operates a host of virtualisation servers in order to be able to provide its usual server infrastructure efficiently on these virtualisation servers. All services used in the company directly or indirectly depend on the virtual IT systems in the virtual infrastructure. There, systems such as the directory service, the central email server, as well as the ERP system are operated. Moreover, the file and printing servers are operated as virtual IT systems.\nThe systems run without any failures for a certain time. After an update of the virtualisation software on the virtualisation servers was completed, the central administration software of the virtualisation servers indicated that the guest tools of the virtual IT systems were no longer up to date. The administrator responsible decides to update the guest tools in the virtual IT systems. The administrator did not have any negative experiences with this update in the past. Since the administrator does not have administrator rights on all virtual IT systems, he/she uses a function of the virtualisation servers for updating purposes which enables updating of the tools on all virtualisation servers without any interaction with the individual virtual IT systems. The administrator starts the update two hours before the general start of the work on a working day.\nHe/she observes how the guest tools are newly installed in the virtual IT systems and initially does not detect any obvious errors, since no error messages are logged on the console of the virtual systems.\nHowever, after a certain number of virtual IT systems was updated, he/she recognises that these are no longer connected to the network. He/she investigates the problem and finds out that the network card drivers of the virtual IT systems were also updated as part of the guest tools. Here, the manufacturer committed an error which resulted in the operating systems of the virtual IT systems not recognising the virtual network card as new hardware. This renders the network card unconfigured. Only after the other administrators arrived at the company, could the network cards be re-configured. Until then, many employees in the corporate administration department are not able to access their data. As a result, large amounts of working time are lost.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.78 Failure of virtual machines due to unfinished data backup processes", "description": "Classic data backup methods are based on agents installed on the IT systems to be backed up. These agents transmit the data to be backed up from the IT system to the data backup server. This server in turn forwards the data to the data backup devices.\nIT systems and the bulk memory used by IT systems can be uncoupled thanks to the introduction of storage networks. This means that the data backup may be transmitted to the data backup server by the storage network instead of from the IT system to be backed up itself. For some storage network products, the data backup devices themselves are part of the storage network and are only controlled by the data backup server. This relieves the backed up IT system and the data backup server from transporting the data for data backup.\nThis concept is emulated and extended by some virtualisation products. For example, the virtualisation servers may provide the bulk memory of virtual IT systems (virtual hard disks) to a data backup system so that this data backup system can backup the data stored on the bulk memory. It is necessary that this virtual hard disk is in a consistent condition so that no inconsistent data is backed up. In order to achieve this, the content of the virtual hard disk is frozen (snapshot). This procedure is completely transparent for the backed up virtual IT system. Since the virtual IT system to be secured continues to run and changes to this hard disk are still performed, these changes are written to a differential file. In so doing, the disk space required by this IT system in total increases. The final size of this differential file depends on how many changes are performed in the file system of the virtual IT system during the backup procedure. Once data backup is complete, the changes performed in the meantime are applied to the frozen condition and the differential file is deleted.\nIf the data contained in the virtualisation environment is backed up incompletely due to the long runtime of the data backup procedure or due to communication issues in the network, the differential file created when the snapshot was made may become very large. This file may be maintained permanently if the data backup process is cancelled suddenly. As a result, the disk space containing the virtual hard disks of the virtual machines to be backed up may be completely exhausted, particularly if several virtual IT systems are backed up in this way simultaneously.\nIf the disk space used for the differential file mentioned above is exhausted, the virtualisation server denies any further write accesses to the virtual hard disk for the virtual IT system and the system switches to an error situation. This may cause the crash of the virtual IT system if the operating system is not able to compensate this error situation.\n", "examples": "The operator of a computer centre virtualised a large number of his server systems. These servers process large amounts of data on a daily basis. This data must be backed up at daily intervals.\nThe data backup puts a considerable strain on the virtual IT systems due to the high data volume and may no longer only be performed during the night. As a consequence, losses of performance occur during the normal working hours. As a consequence, it was decided to no longer perform data backup in the classic, agent-based manner, but to use snapshots. These snapshots are created in the evenings at a certain time in each case, the data is stored and the snapshots are deleted as soon as the backup procedure is complete.\nThis solution runs smoothly for some time, but the data backup volume soon increases in such a significant way that a new data backup process is triggered before the old process is complete.\nShortly afterwards, all virtual IT systems on the virtualisation server fail, since the disk space available is exhausted.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.79 Vulnerabilities in Bluetooth implementation", "description": "The Bluetooth specifications offer many possibilities to implement the described functions. There are already several vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth specifications and the respective implementations of the Bluetooth devices may add additional vulnerabilities.\nThere are several known attack mechanisms that target the vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth implementations in end devices and/or the Bluetooth specifications. Below, some of the important attack mechanisms are explained:\nBluejacking\nBluejacking refers to an attack that involves sending a message via Bluetooth from a Bluetooth end device, e.g. a mobile phone or PDA, to another Bluetooth device. In most cases the purpose is to confuse the receiver. Typical messages are statements such as \"I really like your red trousers.\", \"You should take better care of your mobile on the Cebit.\" or simply \"Hello, you've been bluejacked.\" This demonstrates on the one hand that a real attack would be very easily possible and on the other hand that the user is being watched. However, since Bluetooth only works in close proximity, this is not astonishing.\nThe message sent is simply the name of the sending Bluetooth device that was extended into a\n\"message\". When a connection request is made, the name of the requesting Bluetooth device is usually displayed on the other device. The name of a Bluetooth device is arbitrary and may have up to 248 characters. Therefore, it can also be used to send short messages that are supposed to confuse the user.\nBlueprint\nThe Blueprint method is used to read out the ID of a Bluetooth end device. With this ID the end device version can be determined. By analysing freely accessible information on the vulnerabilities of the device, a targeted attack is then possible.\nBluesnarfing\nBluesnarfing is the unauthorized access to information stored on Bluetooth mobile phones such as address book and calendar entries without the mobile user realising it. Bluesnarfing exploits a security gap of Bluetooth mobile phones. With some models there is free access to the stored data if Bluetooth is turned on and the phone is set to \"visible\".\nBluesnarfing, like Bluejacking, uses an incorrect implementation of an Object Exchange Profile in end devices. This attack establishes a direct connection to a Bluetooth end device and gives access to any data stored on the end device. This means that address books on mobile phones may be spied on without the phone user being any the wiser. It is therefore also possible to read out the\nInternational Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of mobile phones and smartphones. The IMEI of all end devices is unique. For example, an attacker may divert received calls to an end device in their possession by having the end device pretend to be the device that was called. The\nBluesnarfing++ method additionally offers write access to the end device.\nBluebugging\nBluebugging exploits faulty Bluetooth implementations in some older end devices to gain direct access to the end device and/or control of the end device. This attack method uses channels 16 and\n17 of the Bluetooth protocol RFCOMM (Radio Frequency Communication), which serves to emulate serial interfaces, to read data or change the settings of the Bluetooth end device. In addition, Bluebugging may be used to initiate phone calls and thereby to generate costs or to monitor calls made by the user. Using Bluebugging, other services provided by the end device may also be impaired. With older end devices the user has no clue that their device is being attacked. Newer end devices usually display a security prompt indicating that another end device is trying to establish a connection.\nBluesniping\nBluesniping refers to attacks targeting Bluetooth devices at long ranges using directional antennas.\nIn laboratory environments, this has worked on distances of up to two kilometres. Bluesniping extends the various Bluetooth methods of attack to a larger range.\nDenial of Service / BlueSmacking\nDenial of service attacks are usually employed to compromise the Bluetooth interface, rendering the end device unusable, e.g. because pairing requests have to be answered constantly, or to quickly drain the battery of the end device. A typical denial of service attack on Bluetooth devices is\nBlueSmacking. BlueSmacking misuses L2CAP requests to interfere with all Bluetooth devices in range simultaneously. The L2CAP request \"Echo Request\" basically serves to test the readiness to receive and the connection speed, like a ping command.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.80 Poor-quality or missing Bluetooth security mechanisms", "description": "The security mechanisms described in the Bluetooth specifications and implemented by the manufacturers have several design weaknesses. Some of these weaknesses are presented briefly in the following.\nEncryption is not mandatory\nIndependent of the security mode used, encryption of data to be transmitted via Bluetooth is optional and has to be requested explicitly by the applications.\nUnsafe default settings\nThe manufacturer configuration of the default settings is often unsafe. Security functions such as authentication and encryption are often turned off and passwords and PINs are set to default values (\"0000\", \"1234\", etc.). If the devices do not have input devices (e.g. headsets), changing the default settings is very difficult or even impossible.\nGuessing weak PINs with Bluetooth without Secure Simple Pairing (SSP)\nIf two Bluetooth devices are paired, a connection key is generated that is permanently stored in both devices. Its generation is based on the device addresses and a PIN, among other things. The Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) procedure establishes a safe connection channel. If SSP is not used, the authentication information is transmitted without encryption.\nIf a weak PIN is used in a device pairing, an attacker may guess the PIN and calculate the pairing connection key. For this purpose, the attacker only needs to intercept the pairing and then the authentication. If SSP is not used, the attacker may check if the guessed PIN is correct using the recordings of the intercepted protocols.\nThe fact that the PIN is the only secret parameter used to generate the connection key if Bluetooth is used without SSP poses a security risk. From experience we know that it is hard to change the users' or manufacturers' habit of employing weak security settings. Indeed, there are rarely Bluetooth devices that prescribe a minimum length and complexity for the PIN. It is usually up to the user to select a PIN.\nRe-initialisation of semi-permanent connections if Bluetooth is used without SSP\nThe Bluetooth specifications provide the possibility of re-authentication, e.g. if one of the devices lost the connection key. This allows an attacker to introduce a package with a connection re-initialisation request into the communication of two devices at the right moment. This provokes a new pairing that can then be intercepted.\nNo obligatory minimum key length\nIn addition to the length and complexity of the PIN used for authentication (Bluetooth without SSP) the length of the encryption key used to encrypt the transmitted data is also security-relevant. In the Bluetooth specification, a length of 128 bits is obligatory for authentication keys; the length of the key used to encrypt the other package contents may vary. Both devices negotiate the actual key length used when establishing the connection. The Bluetooth specification provides a length of 8 to 128 bits, i.e. a minimum key length of 8 bits could be used without violating the specification.\nThe specification even expressly excludes the possibility of the user changing the minimum key length. It can only be defined via the factory settings of the manufacturer. The achievable encryption quality thereby solely depends on the manufacturer's decision.\nWeak protection of integrity\nA Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC, method to detect transmission errors using a checksum) is used to protect the integrity. This reliably detects random errors during the transmission of data packages, but CRC methods provide no protection against the deliberate manipulation of data packages.\nQuality of the random generator\nFor random generation, the Bluetooth specifications 1.x and 2.0 + EDR stipulate the use of a pseudo random number generator. However, its implementation is not specified. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the random number generators used have weaknesses that can be used to overcome the cryptographic methods. Bluetooth specification 2.1 + EDR requires the use of a random number generator according to the standard FIPS 140-2.\nShortened initialisation vector\nEach transmitted data package is encrypted with a new initialisation vector. The vector is calculated from the time interval of the master and other values. However, the most significant bit of the time interval is omitted. Due to this vulnerability, man-in-the-middle attacks are possible even with encryption, as there are always two different offsets in the jump sequence to an initialisation vector. But a man-in-the-middle attack on an encrypted connection only allows an attacker to manipulate the data stream, not to decrypt it.\nManipulation of encrypted data\nDue to the characteristics of stream ciphers in connection with the CRC used to protect integrity, it is possible to change the cipher text in such a way that the receiver still regards the package as valid. In this way it is possible to manipulate IP headers using a man-in-the-middle attack if\nBluetooth is used without SSP.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.81 Extended rights due to program dialogues on terminal servers", "description": "Secure configurations of terminal servers usually allow for restrictive access. For this, only certain applications listed in a positive list (white list) may be offered to the user and started. Access to the entire desktop allowing for numerous start and interaction options of and with applications is normally prevented. Frequently, program dialogues in approved applications can be used to start additional applications and to extend read and write authorisations.\nUnauthorised file accesses\nDialogues in which files can be opened and stored constitute exposed points of attack in particular in order to gain access to unprotected directories and drives of the terminal server. For example, the users of solutions based on Windows are able to access the actually hidden drive M containing the operating system in the absence of any specific precautions. For Unix based solutions, it is also possible to access all resources within a directory tree in the absence of a corresponding rights concept. Even presumably harmless dialogues such as help functions, printer dialogues, etc. may contain menu items which make spying out the terminal server possible.\nDirectory Traversal\nDirectory Traversal may possibly be used to switch to superior file folders. For this, the usual buttons for navigating the directory structure may be used, for example. If these buttons were disabled by the system administrator, the protection may be undermined by directly entering character strings such as \"\" on Unix systems or \"..\\\" in Windows.\nUniform Resource Identifier\nUniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) identify virtual and physical resources and link local files or files provided on a server to locally installed applications in so doing. If a URI is clicked, the respective file is opened using the previously defined application. This way, the user can directly access the file, the directory of which is otherwise inaccessible to the user. The user is not required to know the exact directory the defined application is contained in, which is why the user may access applications he/she must not access.\nIn addition to the URI types http:// and ftp:// initially defined for browsers, there are now numerous further types, the use of which is no longer only restricted to dialogues in internet applications. A current overview can be found with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) according to RFC4395. Moreover, some programs register their own URIs, which do not yet form any part of the standard.\nExamples for further commonly registered URIs include:\n* file://\nAllows for accessing the local file system * tftp://\nTrivial File Transfer Protocol, allows embedded systems such as routers, printers, etc. to access files, if applicable\n* mailto://\nStarts the email program registered as default in the system * telnet://\nStarts the Telnet application * nfs://\nNetwork File System Protocol, access to NFS file servers * skype://, callto://\nLink to voice-over-IP applications\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.82 Failed or unavailable terminal servers", "description": "In a classic client/server architecture, applications such as text processing are executed on the clients of the users. If there is currently no contact to a required server, it is often possible to continue to work on the clients asynchronously depending on the application. For example, an open document may also be stored to the file server at a later point in time if the network has failed. If an email server is unavailable for a short period, the message is usually buffered and transmitted in a delayed manner by the email client. It is possible that the user does not even recognise such an incident.\nIn a terminal server environment however, the applications are executed centrally and their output is transmitted to the corresponding terminal. If the terminal server is unavailable, no user input can be processed and the applications provided by the server will fail immediately. If the clients, e.g. as is usual in a thin-client environment, obtain the entire user interface, including the operating system, from the remote server, the IT system will fail completely from the user's point of view.\nNormally, only individual users are affected by failures of the network or the terminal server. In many cases, numerous or even all clients of the organisation rely upon the terminal server. If a terminal server fails, a large number of users will be affected simultaneously in this case.\n", "examples": "A municipal service provider introduces terminal servers for several of its business units. For this, several terminal servers are procured, but every business unit is provided with its own terminal server instead of a centralised terminal server farm. This way, the expenses for load balancers are not applicable and the communication paths between client and server can be shortened.\nAfter the terminal servers worked in a stable manner for a couple of months, one server fails and the entire business unit is inoperable until the repair is performed. After a few more months, another business unit expanded and was able to hire numerous additional employees. The increased utilisation of the business unit's terminal server related to this was compensated by distributing the new employees to the less utilised terminal servers of the other business units. This results in unstructured \"chaos\" on the terminal servers and in significantly increased organisational efforts.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 4.83 Malfunctions of self-developed macros in Outlook", "description": "For reasons of interoperability, many software manufacturers equip their tools and applications with programming interfaces, e.g. as Application Programming Interface (API). These allow for also using certain functions from other programs or for extending the scope of functions of the application.

As a deliberate act, self-developed software with a harmful function could also be used for attacks (see T 5.164 Misuse of programming interfaces in Outlook).\nFor Microsoft Outlook, programming interfaces are offered which the users can use to write their own applications or functional extensions (macros) that can send and receive messages, appointments, and tasks using the client.\n", "examples": "* A macro is used to collect certain keywords in emails for a statistic. The macro counts incorrectly due to an index error.

If malicious input by an attacker is processed by the web application, it may become possible to bypass protection mechanisms of the web applications.\nExamples for attacks to web applications based on inadequate validation of input data are SQL injection (see T 5.131 SQL injection), Path Traversal (see T 5.172 Bypassing the authorisation in web applications) and Remote File Inclusion. These attacks can enable unauthorised persons to access the operating system or background systems. In case of a successful attack, data requiring protection can be read or manipulated without authorisation.\nUsually, the successful processing of the input data by the web application is followed by an output of data. The output data can either be transmitted to the user's browser (e.g. status messages or a new entry in the guest book) or passed on to downstream systems. If the data is not adequately validated before output, the output data may contain malicious codes which are interpreted or executed on the target systems.\nThe following examples describe possible consequences of inadequate validation of input and output data:\n* The search function of the web application uses the unfiltered user input to generate database queries. This can be exploited by an attacker to formulate a search query containing additional commands for the data base in addition to the search term. Since the search query is embedded in the database query without first being filtered the commands are executed in the database. This enables the attacker to gain direct access to the database.\n* A web application offers a function for file upload and restricts it to specific file types. In order to determine the file type the web application only checks the file extension and does not consider the content of the file. If a permitted file extension is used for the upload, then files with any content can be transmitted to the server.\n* If input data is automatically modified and adjusted by the filter component (Sanitizing), targeted input by an attacker can convert the data from the filter component to an attack vector.\n* Input and output data may have various encodings (e.g. UTF-8, ISO 8859-1) and notations (e.g. for UTF-8 \".\" = \"2E\" = \"C0 AE\"). Depending on the encoding scheme applied, one value can have different interpretations. If the filter component interprets the data differently than the processing components of the web application, an attacker will be able to encode malicious data (e.g. SQL instructions) so that it is not detected by the filter component. The malicious data from the attacker are thus passed on to the processing components and executed due to the different interpretation.\n* The comment function of a web application allows for the texts to be formatted using HTML. For example, the input is not restricted to specific HTML tags so that an attacker can use this function to place any HTML code on the web application. An attacker can exploit this to manipulate or to overlay elements of the website and to intercept user input (see T 5.175 Clickjacking).\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 4.85 Lack of or poor error handling by web applications", "description": "If errors occur during operation of the web application, this can have unforeseen effects and limit the availability of the web application or even make it unavailable.

In case of failure to handle errors correctly both the operation of the web application and the protection of the functions and data are no longer ensured.\n", "examples": "* During operation, a web application usually uses resources such as open network or file streams in order to be able to access background systems, cached states or other data. While the web application accesses these resources they are often reserved for exclusive access and cannot be used by other processes. If in case of an error the reserved resources are not correctly released, then they may remain in a blocked condition. This may result in the loss of data due to, for example, cached changes not being able to be written correctly.\n* If errors occur during execution of the security components (e.g. authentication, authorisation) and if these are poorly handled, this may lead to uncontrolled execution of the requested tasks. Tasks normally declined may be allowed in the event of an error.\n* Error messages can contain detailed information on the cause of the error which is not required by the user but allows targeted attacks. Such detailed information includes stack traces, debugging output, error messages in case of invalid SQL queries, information on web servers and other application components used. Even seemingly uncritical information such as the notification in case of a failed login attempt with user name and password that the user name is known but an invalid password was entered can be exploited, for example, in brute-force attacks. In this case the attacker knows that the user name exists.\n* If the error handling is performed on the client (e.g. web browser), it can be manipulated or disabled.

IT early-warning systems are used in order to already issue warnings during a security incident, even before possible effects are noticeable. This is particularly effective for central logging. Such security incidents can be detected more quickly due to reasonably analysed log events.\nHowever, monitoring must include an alarm component. Otherwise, monitoring the entire information system and analysing the logged data, but not generating any alarms, has negative effects on the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of the systems.\nFalse-Positives and False-Negatives\nThresholds set too low or too high constitute frequent errors in alarm components. These thresholds determine the point where alarms are generated. Thresholds set too low may cause false alarms (False-Positives).

The more access rights a person has to the files and directories of the IT systems and the more ways this person has to access information, the more serious the manipulations they will be able to make. If such manipulations are not detected in time, then the smooth operation of business processes and specialised tasks may be seriously disrupted.\nInformation or software can be manipulated out of revenge to intentionally cause damage or for personal or financial reasons, among others.\n", "examples": "* In a Swiss financial company, the application software for certain financial services was tampered with by an employee. This made it possible for him to obtain sizeable amounts of money illegally.\n* It is very common for employees to copy customer databases when leaving a company in order to use the customer data for other purposes (i.e. financial gain). Such illegally obtained data of private customers have been used, for example, to produce fake contracts.\nEmployees who leave a government agency or company in anger could also deliberately destroy information or IT systems or block access to important information or IT systems.\n* The sensitive information in archived documents usually requires special protection. Manipulation of such documents is especially serious because the manipulation can go unnoticed for years, and even when discovered, it may no longer be possible to properly investigate the incident.\n* An employee in accounting became so angry over the promotion of the co-worker with whom she shared an office that she gained access to her co-worker's computer while she stepped out of the office for a short time. She seriously affected the company's published annual operating results just by changing some numbers in the monthly balance sheet.\n* An employee is angry because his supervisor did not give him a pay raise. He is so angry that he sends a document disguised as a business letter and containing a macro virus to some of his work colleagues via email. Opening these documents causes numerous files on the affected systems to be modified.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.3 Unauthorised entry into a building", "description": "If unauthorised persons are able to break in to a building or individual rooms in a building, then the organisation may be subject to a variety of additional security threats as a consequence. Such threats include the theft or manipulation of information or IT systems, for example. Safeguards intended to counteract unauthorised entry therefore also help against the corresponding secondary threats.\nWhen an experienced perpetrator conducts a well-planned attack, the amount of time the attacker has to pursue his goal is decisive. The goal of the break-in may be to steal IT components or other goods that are easy to sell, but could also be to copy or manipulate data or IT systems. In this case, manipulations that are not so obvious can actually cause much more damage than direct acts of destruction.\nProperty damage can also result from the unauthorised intrusion itself. Windows and doors are forced opened and damaged, which means they need to be repaired or replaced.\n", "examples": "* After breaking in to an office building at night, the perpetrators were not able to find anything of value. Out of frustration, they sprayed a dry powder fire extinguisher in the offices until it was empty. The damage caused by the break-in itself was minimal, but the damage caused by the vandalism was disproportionately high due to the cleaning costs and the work disruptions.\n* When breaking in to a company on a weekend, minor damage was caused to a window as it was forced open. It initially appeared as though only a coffee cash box and some small furnishings and equipment were stolen, but it was discovered during a routine check conducted later that a central server was cleverly manipulated exactly at the time of the break-in.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.4 Theft", "description": "Theft of data media, IT systems, accessories, software, or data not only results in the expense of having to replace the equipment or restore it to working order, but also in losses resulting from a lack of availability. In addition, damage can arise from a loss of data confidentiality and the consequences of this loss.\nMobile IT systems, which are easy to transport inconspicuously, are often targeted for theft as well as expensive IT systems such as servers.\n", "examples": "* During the spring of 2000, a notebook disappeared from the US State Department. In an official statement, it was stated that the possibility that the notebook contained confidential information could not be ruled out. Nor was it known whether the machine was protected against unauthorised access by encryption or any other means. A warning had already been issued during security inspections about inadequate security checks.\n* In a German government office, several break-ins occurred through the same unprotected window. Some mobile IT systems disappeared in addition to other valuable items. It was impossible to completely rule out the possibility that documents had been copied or manipulated.\n* In the United Kingdom, there was a series of data privacy violations in which confidential documents were disclosed because the corresponding data media had been stolen. In one case, computer hard disks containing highly personal information recorded during security checks of the staff were stolen from the Royal Air Force.\n* An employee of a call centre made copies of large amounts of confidential customer data shortly before he was forced to leave the company.

The results are very similar to those of an attack except that vandalism is not planned and executed like an attack and is usually the result of spontaneous, blind destructiveness instead.\nOutsiders (such as disappointed burglars or demonstrators that get out of control) as well as insiders (such as frustrated or psychologically unstable employees) are potential perpetrators of vandalism. The actual threat posed by vandalism is more difficult to estimate than the threat posed by an attack because vandals do not usually have a direct reason for committing the vandalism. Vandalism can be triggered by differences of opinion, personal problems, bullying, or a poor work climate, among other reasons.\n", "examples": "* A customer at one company became so angry because he had to wait too long that he damaged a network cable running through a cable channel in the waiting area. This resulted in disrupted connections in the LAN over a long period of time because the company was not able to find the direct source of the error.\n* Vandalism can also be carried out virtually. Misleading advertisements for the product of one company made certain parts of the population very displeased. As a result, the marketing web sites of the company in the Internet were defaced by an attacker.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.6 Attack", "description": "The technical possibilities for carrying out an attack are numerous: throwing bricks, creating an explosion using explosives, the use of firearms, or arson, for example. Whether or not an organisation is subject to the risk of an attack, and if so, to what extent, depends highly on the type of tasks performed and the political/social climate as well as on the location of the building and its surroundings. Company and government agencies operating in politically controversial areas are more exposed to this threat than other organisations. Organisations located near areas commonly used for demonstrations are at greater risk than more remote locations. In Germany, the Federal\nOffice of Criminal Investigation or one of the state offices of criminal investigation can be contacted to obtain an assessment of the risk of a politically motivated attack or if you suspect you could be the target of such an attack.\nWhen considering this assessment, one particular feature of archives, i.e. that a large number of documents and data is stored in a relatively small space, must be taken into account. Such documents could include patient data, contracts, legal documents, or wills, for example. Their destruction can have far-reaching consequences, not only for the location where the documents are stored, but also for other users. For example, it could be necessary in such a case to re-acquire and re-record the information destroyed, which could incur great time and expense. Under some circumstances, certain information may even be irretrievably lost. For this reason, attacks to paper document archives and electronic archives can cause significant damage.\n", "examples": "* In the 1980s, there was a bomb attack on the computer centre of a large federal agency in Cologne. Due to the use of high-power explosives, the explosion not only destroyed windows and walls, but also numerous IT systems in the computer centre.\n* A tax office in the Rhine region is shut down for several hours practically every year due to bomb threats.\n* The attack on the World Trade Center in New York on 11 September 2001 not only killed many people, but also destroyed a large amount of IT equipment. As a result, several companies had serious problems resuming business.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.7 Line tapping", "description": "Due to the low risk of detection, line tapping is a potential threat to information security that should not be overlooked. Basically, there is no such thing as a tap-proof cable. Due to the low risk of detection, line tapping is a potential threat to IT security that should not be overlooked. Whether a line is actually being tapped can only be determined using sophisticated instruments.\nThe decision to tap a line basically depends on whether the information that could be obtained is worth the technical and financial expenditure and the risk of detection. This question can only be answered by knowing what capabilities the attacker has and what his or her particular interests are. It is therefore impossible to know for sure what information, and therefore which lines, could be targets for tapping.\nIt can be very easy to tap a line. With some types of LAN cabling, access to a LAN socket may be sufficient to eavesdrop on all the network traffic in the local network. The risk is greater when an attacker has access to passive or perhaps even active connection elements of an IT network. It is even easier to intercept network traffic on wireless networks (wireless LAN / radio LAN, IEEE\n802.11). Furthermore, the risk of being detected while listening in on a wireless network is virtually nil.\nThe insecure transmission of authentication data using plain text protocols like HTTP, ftp, or telnet is especially critical since it is easy in these cases to determine the position of the data entered by the user in the transmitted packet due to the simple structure of the protocols (see also T 2.87 Use of insecure protocols in public networks). It is therefore relatively easy to automatically analyse such connections.\nFor example, in the first step, password sniffer programmes could be used to collect passwords when they are transmitted to a system. This would then enable the attacker to gain access to this IT system and then carry out further attacks locally on the computer.\n", "examples": "* It is wrong to assume that messages sent by e-mail are the equivalent of letters in the classical sense. -Since e-mail messages can be read anywhere along their journey through the Internet, it is much more realistic to compare them to postcards.\n* Some manufacturers supply sniffer programmes along with their operating systems to debug networks, but these programmes can also be used to intercept data.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.8 Manipulation of lines", "description": "Apart from line tapping (see T 5.7 Line tapping), manipulation of lines can also have other targets:\n* Frustrated staff members could manipulate lines in such a way that inadmissible connections would be established within and outside the organisation's own IT set-up. Often, the aim would be to merely disrupt IT operations.\n* Lines could be manipulated in such a way that private use would be at the expense of the network provider. Apart from the resultant costs regarding the use of chargeable communication lines, lines and resources would be blocked by such private use.\n* The destruction of IT lines can cause considerable financial damage to an institution.\nThe primary cabling in larger properties and lines realising the IT or telecommunication connection to providers often have a high protection requirement in terms of availability.\n", "examples": "* During building works on the premises of a large company, violators were able to open a cable inspection manhole in an area of the construction site with poor access protection. A pruning shear was used to cut a glass fibre bundle of the primary cabling. As a consequence several production buildings were isolated from the IT network and the resultant operational malfunctions and business interruptions caused damage amounting to millions of euros.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.9 Unauthorised use of IT systems", "description": "Without mechanisms for the identification and authentication of users, it is virtually impossible to gain control over the unauthorised use of IT systems. Even on IT systems that provide identification and authentication functions in the form of user IDs and password checks, there is still a risk of unauthorised use when the passwords and user IDs are obtained illicitly.\nIn order to guess the secret password, an unauthorised person could enter a possible password during the login procedure. The corresponding response of the IT system would indicate whether the password was correct or not. Passwords can be guessed by trial and error in this manner.\nHowever, a much more promising attack approach is to use a single word as an assumed password and try it out with all user IDs entered in the system. A valid user ID/password combination is often found in this manner when the number of users is correspondingly large.\nIf it is possible to misuse the identification and authentication function, then it may even be possible to automate the attempts to log in by developing a program that systematically tests all conceivable passwords.\n", "examples": "* In 1988, an Internet worm exploited a vulnerability present in some Unix operating systems to find valid passwords even though the passwords were stored in encrypted form. To accomplish this, the program tried all entries in a dictionary by encrypting them with the local encoding function and comparing them to the stored, encrypted passwords. A match meant that a valid password had been discovered.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.10 Abuse of remote maintenance ports", "description": "Remote maintenance ports allow for access to IT systems from the outside. Where remote maintenance ports are insufficiently protected, it is conceivable that unauthorised persons may get access to these IT systems without being noticed, under certain circumstances even with administrative authorisations. For example, attackers would be able to perform all administration tasks, once they have mastered the authentication mechanisms such as password entry. If the system fails completely or experiences serious operational disruptions, corrupt data, or the loss of the confidentiality of all data stored on the affected IT system, then the result could be significant financial losses under some circumstances.\n", "examples": "* The Remote Support Facility (RSF) is generally used on mainframe computers running the z/OS operating system to report system errors to the manufacturer. RSF can also be used by the manufacturer to install patches to the microcode. The misuse of the RSF remote access capability in z/OS systems therefore poses a serious threat.\n* Because the password policy was poorly implemented or the password policy was too weak, the password for a maintenance computer of a telecommunication system could be discovered by systematic trial-and-error (using a dictionary attack). Once the attacker had mastered the password of the system, he was able to administrate the telecommunication system according to his own needs.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.11 Loss of confidentiality of data stored in PBX systems", "description": "In PBX systems, personal and internal data is stored for longer periods of time, for example on hard disks or memory cards. Personal data includes call-charge data, configuration data, authorisations and electronic telephone books, passwords, and charge account numbers, for example. For invoice generation, PBX systems are often able to record connection datasets which at the least contain information about the subscriber number called, the time of the call, and the duration of the call.\nThis information could be used to derive communication profiles for individual terminal devices or users. Therefore, connection data is interesting to unauthorised persons and must be protected against unauthorised access.\nWhen operating VoIP PBX systems, voice information may also be logged very efficiently, since this is already present in a digital form. For example, all telephone calls made can be stored in their entirety on hard disks and copied to another system for later evaluation. There is the risk of such a logging function for telephone calls being enabled without authorisation and then used to attack the confidentiality of the data.\nMany PBX applications work with personal data and under some circumstances forward it to other applications. Unified Messaging Systems must be mentioned specifically, where the effects of a loss of confidentiality may be severe due to the centralised collection of different message types.\nThe stored data may also be read and changed by the administration personnel of the telecommunication system. The type and scope of this access depends on the type of system and, if configured, the scope of the rights granted. The administration personnel are granted this access both for on-site maintenance as well as for remote maintenance purposes. When remote maintenance is outsourced, the company contracted to perform the maintenance (generally the manufacturer or a service provider) is also able to read and change the data at any time.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.12 Interception of telephone calls and data transmissions", "description": "If telephone calls or data is transmitted in an unencrypted form, there is generally the risk of attackers eavesdropping on or reading the information. For example, attackers could tap directly into the telephone cables or listen in on a switching PBX system positioned between the callers.\nIt is easier to eavesdrop on telephone calls and data transmissions when VoIP is used when compared to classic PBX systems. All voice information is transmitted in an IP media stream, for example using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). All possible types of attacks on IP data networks are available using techniques such as spoofing and sniffing.\nIn many PBX systems, callers can leave a message for the recipient if the recipient is not available by telephone at the time of the call. Some answering machines, especially those in VoIP systems, send this information in the form of an audio file in an email. The contents of this email could be intercepted and listened to directly by an attacker just like with a VoIP media stream.\nMoreover, telephone calls amongst colleagues may be intercepted by misusing the performance characteristics both for VoIP and for line switching PBX systems. An example includes the three-way conference. When subscriber A receives a call for subscriber B, he/she might try to secretly establish a three-way conference call instead of just forwarding the call. If subscriber B has a telephone without a display, subscriber B will not notice this.\nIn addition, it is possible for third parties to listen in on calls by activating disabled features, some of which are not allowed to be used in Germany. One example includes the silent monitoring feature. Activation of such features requires more detailed knowledge of the system, but this is not a serious obstacle due to the large amount of information available for free on the internet.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.13 Wiretapping of rooms using PBX terminal devices", "description": "As a matter of principle, it is possible to wiretap rooms using microphones in terminal devices.\nHere, two variants are differentiated. In the first case, the threat arises through the use of one terminal device. Examples include intelligent terminal devices with built-in microphones such as multimedia PCs, PDAs, mobile telephones, but also answering machines. Such terminal devices can be manipulated remotely from the public network or via the LAN to activate the built-in microphone when the corresponding functionalities are implemented (see also T 5.40 Monitoring rooms using computers equipped with microphones and cameras). A well-known example of this includes the so-called \"baby watch\" function available in some phones or answering machines.\nIn the second case, the functionality of a PBX system is exploited in combination with correspondingly equipped terminal devices. This threat arises through the misuse of the \"voice calling\" feature in combination with the \"hands-free calling\" option. This combination can cause the system to operate like an intercom system under certain circumstances, and therefore be used to wiretap a room. Normally, a short, single warning signal is generated when the microphone is activated Warning signals may be prevented by a corresponding configuration, however. Anyone able to administer a PBX system would in this case be able to wiretap any room containing a correspondingly equipped telephone from every terminal device with access to the PBX system or the system cluster.\nWhen using VoIP softphones, there is an additional threat scenario. These applications allow the use of a multimedia PC as a telephone terminal device. The multimedia PC is generally used for other tasks as well, for example to surf the internet. Since a microphone is required to transmit voice data, it may be activated by malware under some circumstances and the environment of the PC may be wiretapped.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.14 Call charges fraud", "description": "Call charges fraud in connection with data or telecommunication servers has the objective of transferring the cost for telephone calls or data transmissions to another person, for example by misusing a PBX system. Corresponding manipulations can be carried out in a variety of ways. On the one hand, attackers might attempt to abuse the features available on a PBX system to charge calls. For example, call forwarding or dial-in options that can be programmed remotely are suitable for this. On the other hand, rights can be granted in such a way that incoming \"outside lines\" occupy outgoing \"outside lines\". This way, the caller may be connected directly to the \"dial tone\" when a certain number is dialled from outside, with the cost for this being borne by the PBX system operator.\nAlong with the technical possibilities, call charges fraud may also be performed by the users themselves.

A distinction should be made here between simply trying out all possible character combinations up to a certain length (known as a brute force attack) and trying out every entry in a list of character combinations (a dictionary attack). The two approaches can also be combined.\nMost operating systems store user names and passwords in a file or database (e.g. the passwd or shadow file in Unix or the RACF database in z/OS). However, many operating systems store at least the passwords using cryptographic mechanisms and not as plain text. If the file is not adequately protected against unauthorised access, then an attacker may be able to copy this file and then subject the file to a brute force attack with the help of a high-performance computer without having to worry about the total access time.\nThe time it takes to discover a password in a brute force attack depends on the following:\n* the time it takes to perform a password check,\n* the length of the password, and * the character composition of the password (e.g. letters/numbers).\nThe time it takes to check a password depends heavily on the corresponding system and its processing and transmission speeds.

Furthermore, he can assume the identity of any user on his system without being detected by another user, which means it is possible for him to send emails under a different name or to read and/or delete other users' emails.\n* There are a number of ways in which superuser privileges can be abused. These include misuse of the su command and of incorrectly administered superuser files (files with root as the owner and with the s-bit set).\n* A threat is also posed by the automatic mounting of exchangeable data media: Such media are mounted immediately after they are placed in the drive. Then everyone has access to the files stored there. Any user can then obtain superuser rights using the s-bit programs stored on the mounted drive.\n* Depending on the Unix variant and the base hardware used, it may be possible to activate the monitor mode or to boot in single-user mode if there is access to the console.

The address books facilitate the sending of faxes, since the users must only select the respective recipient and do not have to enter the recipient's fax number for every fax. If an address book contains an incorrect fax number for recipient, the fax will be sent to the wrong recipient when using this entry. Frequently, address books provide the option of consolidating several addressees to form a group.

The information may be obtained by gaining possession of the device or the corresponding components.\nFor fax devices printing with the help of the thermal transfer procedure, incoming fax transmissions are initially written to an intermediate support film, with the help of which they are then printed. This film is consumable material and requires regular replacement; therefore the film can be removed easily. If an unauthorised person gains possession of this film (by theft or during disposal), he/she may reproduce the content with simple technical means. Through this, he/she may gain knowledge of the information contained on several hundred fax pages.\nThe majority of fax machines are equipped with a clipboard (document memory, buffer) which outgoing faxes can be read in until successful transmission and/or incoming faxes are buffered in before being printed. Depending on the fax machine, this memory may contain a larger number of fax pages and may generally be printed by anyone who has access the fax machine.\nFax servers\nFax servers are applications installed on IT systems which are normally equipped with at least one hard disk or capable of accessing a drive using the network. These servers are used to store fax transmissions until they can be delivered to a recipient. Moreover, state-of-the-art operating systems use swap files that may also contain residual information. At this point, there is the risk of this information being analysed by unauthorised persons if they gain access to this fax server. For example, if a hard disk fails during the warranty period, the hard disk must be returned to the dealer or the manufacturer in order to assert the warranty claims. Here, it is problematic that the hard disk may still contain data which unauthorised persons may gain knowledge of in this way. Frequently, it is not possible to use software tools to delete the data from faulty hard disks.\nUnauthorised access to fax data in the fax client is possible if a workstation computer and/or the fax software installed on this computer is protected insufficiently.

However, it must be observed that one DIN A4 fax page consumes approx. 70 kB. Given the hard disk capacities usual today, a very large number of fax transmissions of this kind would have to be received. Furthermore, it must be taken into consideration that only a limited number of lines and/or channels are available and that every fax transmission requires time for processing the fax protocol. On that note, the fax server may only be overloaded if the selected hard disk was too small or if fax transmissions are archived on the fax server.\nAs opposed to traditional fax machines, overloading a fax server due to outgoing fax transmissions is absolutely possible.

Social engineering exploits human characteristics such as the willingness to help others, trust, fear, or respect for authority. Employees can be manipulated using social engineering so that they perform unauthorised tasks. A typical case of attacks carried out with the help of social engineering includes the manipulation of employees by calling them on the telephone and masquerading as one of the following persons, for example:\n* a receptionist whose superior wants to do something quickly but has forgotten his password and needs it urgently now,\n* an administrator who calls because of a system error, since he/she needs the user's password to eliminate the error,\n* a telephone technician who wants to know some technical details, for example the telephone number of a connected modem and the settings of the modem,\n* an outsider who would like to talk to Mr. X who is not available at the moment. Telling the outsider that Mr. X will be absent for three days also means telling him/her that Mr X's account will not be used and therefore will be unobserved during this time.\nIf asked critical questions, the inquisitive caller may say that he/she is somebody \"important\" or\n\"just an assistant\".\nAnother strategy used in systematic social engineering is to build a long-term relationship with the victim. By making numerous trivial telephone calls in advance, the attacker is able to collect information and build trust, which he/she can then exploit later.\nSuch attacks can also be conducted in several stages by using the knowledge and techniques gained in the previous stages.\n", "examples": "* It is much easier for an attacker if he/she succeeds in bringing the victims to call him/her on their own accord. For example, the attacker could manipulate the telephone system of the organisation targeted in such a way that all calls to the administrator are forwarded to him/her. For example, this may happen after conducting a successful social engineering attack on the telephone technician or after successfully compromising an insecurely configured telephone system from the outside. If the attacker is then able to conduct a denial-of-service attack, for example, the victim of the attack will inform the administrator of the attack. However, the victim will only be able to reach the attacker due to the manipulation of the telephone system. During normal daily business, no one would normally consider questioning the fact that the person on the other end of the line is a \"real\" administrator.\nMany users know that they are not allowed to give their passwords to anyone else. Social engineers are aware of this and therefore need to find other ways to reach their goals. Examples of this include:\n* An attacker may ask the victim to execute commands or run programs the victim is not familiar with, for example to help solve an alleged problem with the IT. However, the request could contain disguised commands for changing the data access rights. The attacker may then be able to gain access to sensitive information.\n* Many users use a strong password, but they use the same password for several accounts. If an attacker is running a useful network service (such as an email address system) the users need to provide authentication for, then the attacker could obtain the desired passwords and login information. Many users will use the login data for this service for other services as well.\nWhen conducting a social engineering attack, the attacker will not always be visible because there are also other versions of this type of attack where the attacker remains in the background. In many cases, the victims never even find out that they have been exploited. If this is the case, the attacker does not even have to worry about criminal prosecution and also has a source for obtaining additional information later.\nThe use of email and internet services offers numerous ways of obtaining information under false pretences. Once the trust of the victim is gained, it is easy for the attacker to provide the victim with an email containing an attached Trojan horse, for example. Since the victim knows the attacker and considers him/her to be trustworthy, the email and the attachment are also considered trustworthy and are then opened.\nSocial networks\nSocial networks on the internet offer a good basis for social engineering. These platforms can be used in order to obtain numerous background information about persons. The information people disclose by means of their profile may be collected and used as a basis for obtaining further information.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.43 Macro viruses", "description": "When files are exchanged (e.g. using data media or by email), there is a risk that other macros connected to the document or embedded editor commands are also transferred or transmitted in addition to the actual file itself (text file, spreadsheet etc.).

Unfortunately, the addresses used in Layer 2 of the OSI model such as Ethernet or hardware addresses are also easy to falsify and therefore provide no reliable basis for authentication.\nIn LANs in which the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used, many more effective spoofing attacks are possible. ARP is used to find the 48-bit hardware or Ethernet address belonging to a\n32-bit IP address. If a corresponding entry is not found in an internal table in the computer, an ARP broadcast packet is transmitted with the unknown IP address.

The manipulated data packets are then forwarded to their original, intended destination. The receiving unit is not able to detect the manipulation of the data, and handles the information in the packet as though it had been sent directly from the management station.\n* If the owner of a network management station gains access to a network administered using SNMP, it is possible for the owner to impersonate a community (an administrative area within SNMP). As a result, an unauthorised user is able to feign an authorised identity, and read all the information from the agents (objects to be managed in the network, such as routers) as well as perform all management operations. In this case, the agents are not able to distinguish between the correct and incorrect identities.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.62 Misuse of resources via remote IT systems", "description": "This threat was eliminated in 2008 with the 10th version of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.63 Manipulation via the ISDN D-channel", "description": "The sum of all physical links between a subscriber and a digital exchange assigned to that subscriber is referred to as a connection network.

When several such terms are linked together in a query using OR's, the response time for the query increases accordingly.\nIncorrect statements\nThe parser represents the implementation in the database management system (DBMS) of the query language provided by the DBMS (e.g. SQL). The parser checks every query directed to the database for correctness according to the rules of the query language and executes the query if it passes the check. If the query language is not defined uniquely and conclusively or the query language is implemented incorrectly by the parser, then manipulated statements can be utilised to prevent the use of the services of the database if the statements are accepted by the parser. The parser checks such statements and executes them after they pass the check, which then leads to unpredictable results and possibly even a database crash.\nToo much output\nUnconditional queries or queries restricted using criteria encountered frequently in the database can generate very long output that can overload the DBMS under some circumstances.\nBuffer overflow\nA database can also be forced to fail by inducing a buffer overflow in the database system. In this case, an attacker can attempt to construct a complex query that places a high load on the DBMS, for example.

Netiquette (blend of net and etiquette) refers to the rules of politeness, which became standard practice for use of the internet over time, particularly in the news groups, and the observance of which is supposed to ensure that everyone can use the internet efficiently and to everyone's satisfaction.\nHigh data traffic generated deliberately by means of the aforementioned may overload the local email system so that it is rendered inoperative.

As such numbers are not very easy to memorise, almost all IP addresses are assigned names by the\nDomain Name System (DNS).\nDNS spoofing refers to a successful attempt by an attacker to falsify the IP address assigned to a computer name, which means that the name will be converted to the wrong IP address and vice-versa. In classic DNS spoofing, the client PC is not manipulated by malware, but vulnerabilities existing in the DNS communication are exploited. As a result of this, it is possible to execute the following attacks, among others:\n* r-services (rsh, rlogin, rsh): These services permit authentication based on of the name of the client. The server knows the IP address of the client and requests its name via DNS. By manipulating the DNS, it may be possible for an attacker to log in to the r-service and to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information.\n* Web spoofing: An intruder could assign the address www.bsi.bund.de to the wrong computer, which would then be addressed each time http://www.bsi.bund.de is entered.\nThe ease with which it is possible to perform DNS spoofing depends on how the network being attacked is configured. Since no computer can possess all DNS information available globally, computers always need to depend on the information of other DNS servers. To reduce the frequency of DNS queries, most resolving DNS servers temporarily store the information they have received from other DNS servers for a certain length of time.\nAnother possibility to cause damage using DNS spoofing is direct intrusion into a DNS server.\nHowever, this case is not considered further here. Instead, the principal shortcomings of DNS are mentioned.\n", "examples": "* A user on the computer named pc.customer.com wants to access the computer named www.company-x.com and then the computer of their competitor www.company-y.com. In order to access www.company-x.com, the user must first request his resolving DNS server ns.customer.com for the corresponding IP address. However, his server does not know the IP address of this computer and therefore requests it from the advertising DNS server ns.company-x.com. This server replies with the IP address, which is then forwarded by ns.customer.com to the user and then stored. If the reply packet from ns.company-x.com not only contains the IP address of the computer named www.company-x.com, but also contains a false IP address for www.company-y.com , then this address is also stored. If the user now tries to access www.company-y.com, his resolving DNS server will not request the IP address any more from the DNS server ns.company-y.com. Instead, his DNS server will provide him with the false information snuck on to his computer by ns.company-x.com. In current versions of DNS server products an attack in this form is no longer possible. However, modified or improved versions of the attack exist, which are successful even in current versions.\n* Company X knows that a user on the computer named pc.customer.com wants to access the computer of its competitor, www.company-y.com. Company X prevents this by requesting the DNS server ns.customer.com for the IP address of www.company-x.com. This DNS server then needs to request the name server ns.company-x.com for the IP address and receives, like in the first example, the wrong information for www.company-y.com.\nThese two examples are based on the assumption that a DNS server accepts additional data that it has not even requested. New versions of DNS software (e.g. BIND) no longer have this error and therefore prevent this type of attack. However, it is still always possible to create false DNS entries using IP spoofing, but this type of attack is much more complicated technically, see also T 5.48 IP-Spoofing.\nBoth forms of attack have one thing in common: The aim is that the attacked computer temporarily stores incorrect assignments of IP addresses and names. This is referred to as Cache Poisoning. Since DNS servers store domain information, as described in the second example, such forged data can be widely distributed. If a corresponding request is sent to the manipulated DNS server, this server will return the forged data. The receiver of the response in turn stores the forged data and its cache is therefore also \"poisoned\". The length of time for stored data to expire can be configured (Time to Live, TTL). If a manipulated address is requested form the resolving DNS server, then it will not send a request to a different DNS server until the set length of time has expired. Thus, it is possible for manipulated DNS information to persist for a long time, although they have already been corrected on the DNS server originally attacked.\nCache poisoning is one of the most dangerous forms of attack for DNS. If, for example, an attacker is able to take the name resolution for a domain by manipulating the entries in such a way that requests are sent to his DNS servers, then all sub-domains are automatically affected by this.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.79 Unauthorised acquisition of administrator rights under Windows systems", "description": "A local administrator account is created in every standard installation of a Windows NT-based system. This applies to the client versions as well as the server versions. In contrast to accounts created by users, this local, predefined administrator account cannot be deleted nor locked in\nWindows NT and Windows 2000. This is to prevent the administrator from being locked out deliberately or accidentally (and therefore make administration impossible). One problem in this regard is that the predefined administrator account cannot be locked even when the number of invalid attempts to enter the password before locking the account, which is specified in the account policy, is exceeded. Without corresponding countermeasures, this permits an attacker to try out any number of passwords using special programmes. It only became possible to deactivate the predefined administrator account under Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and higher. In\nWindows Vista and higher, this account is deactivated by default in a standard installation.\nHowever, it is still impossible to delete this account.\nThere are other ways of obtaining a password assigned to an administrator account for the purpose of acquiring administrator privileges. For example, if a Windows NT-based computer is administered remotely, then there is a risk that the login password entered during the authentication process will be transmitted in plain text (depending on the authentication procedure used) and allow an attacker to record the password. Windows Vista and Server 2008 already provide IPsec support with standard installations, but the encryption still must be configured and activated. Even if the system has been configured so that login passwords are only transmitted in encrypted form, it is still possible for an attacker to record the encrypted password and decrypt it with the help of appropriate software. This applies to Windows NT in particular when the older NTLM procedure is used. The default procedure used in Windows 2000 and later Windows versions operated in a domain environment is Kerberos, which provides more robust protection against such attacks.\nFurthermore, every password on a Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 system is stored in encrypted form in the registry and in a file stored in the %Systemroot%\\System32\\Repair or\n%Systemroot%/Repair directory on emergency repair disks (and possibly on tape backups). If an attacker is able to obtain this file, then he could try to decrypt the necessary password with the help of appropriate software. The Windows versions Vista and Server 2008 and higher do not have a Repair directory any more.\nIt is possible using special malware for an attacker logged locally into a Windows NT computer to add an arbitrary user account to the Administrators group, and therefore grant administrator rights to the owner of this account.\nOther examples of attacks to obtain administration privileges without authorisation include the following:\n* It is also possible to extend privileges (referred to as privilege escalation) by exploiting vulnerabilities in programmes or services that run with administrative or system privileges.\n* Technical attacks can be used in combination with social engineering methods. For example, the local system with normal user privileges could be manipulated, and a key logger can be installed. If an attacker gets an administrator to log in, the key logger will record the administrators user name and password.\n* Passwords could be overwritten using a different boot medium (e.g. a diskette/CD-ROM/USB storage device).\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.80 Hoax", "description": "A hoax is a message containing a warning of new and spectacular computer viruses or other IT problems to generate widespread panic, which has no factual basis whatsoever.

In turn, this could then make it impossible to decrypt the data or check its authenticity.\n* Documents stored in electronic archives are not considered conclusive evidence when the integrity of the documents cannot be verified.\nLosses of integrity can occur in various ways:\n* Information can be lost due to the ageing of the data media.\n* Transmission errors can occur when transmitting data.\n* Malicious software can be used to change or destroy entire databases.\n* Entering the wrong data can trigger unwanted transactions, which often go unnoticed for a long time.\n* Attackers can attempt to manipulate data for other purposes, e.g. to gain access to other IT systems or databases.\n* Manipulation of the index database of an electronic archive can cause it to archive the wrong documents or to archive or retrieve falsified documents.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.86 Manipulation of management parameters", "description": "Management systems may also be used to launch an attack to a local computer system with the help of deliberate misconfigurations. Such misconfigurations may be caused in a variety of ways. Manipulations both to the management platform and to the administrated devices are possible. Network management systems using SNMP are particularly susceptible to attacks where management parameters are manipulated deliberately (e.g. by an SNMP client of the network).\nDepending on the configurable parameters, the attacks range from simple \"denial-of-service\" attacks (e.g. by changing IP addresses) up to data modifications (e.g. after changing access rights).\nIf network components are administrated by a management system, all configuration parameters administrated by the management system should only be changed by the management system.\nHowever, depending on the management system, it can still be possible to also change the configuration parameters of the component locally. If a PC is administrated by a network management system, e.g. via SNMP, a local user may use a local SNMP client program (when knowing the SNMP password) or a local control element (e.g. at a printer) to change the settings.\nThis may at least result in inconsistencies in the network management system, but may also be used deliberately to cause security gaps. For example, the retrieval of shared directories via SNMP using the network could be allowed subsequently for a Windows computer.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.87 Web spoofing", "description": "Within the framework of web spoofing, an attacker forges an existing website, i.e. he designs one of his own websites in such a way that it looks like the website of a known organisation. The already existing website that was reproduced is not changed in so doing, but continues to be available in its genuine form. With the help of different tricks, the attacker then tries to lure users to the website he put on the web.\nTo do so, he may select its web address in such a way that a large number of users assume they are connected to a certain organisation simply because of the address they entered. For example, he may register a site where the host name is identical to the one of the original website, but where the top level domain was changed. However, he may also try to use an address containing frequent typing errors (\"Typosquatting\") and lure the users to the forged site this way.\nAnother possibility is to distribute manipulated links. Different character sets and similarly looking letters can be used in order to create deceptively authentic links. For example, figures looking like letters at the first glance or similar letters may be used. Along with the hardly discernible difference between \"I\" (capital \"i\") and \"l\" (lower case \"L\"), similarly looking letters may also be used. This, for example, includes the Latin and the Cyrillic writing style of the letter \"a\", which looks similar but is coded differently.\nUsers may also be provided with addresses not identical to those addresses the link would lead to.\nFor example, the URL of the trustworthy site may be displayed although the link leads to a forged site by using a HTML link. Another option is to prefix the user name and the password to the site name in the URL. Users not familiar with this writing style assume that they are directed to the website specified as user name/password, although the actually used host name is contained significantly more towards the end of the URL.\n", "examples": "* The XY bank uses the URL www.xy-bank.de for its website.

For this reason, they are willing to enter their account numbers, PINs, or other access codes.\n* The website whitehouse.com experienced an eventful history. However, this website never was the internet presence of the U.S. White House , as many users initially assumed, but contained changing commercial or pornographic content.\n* The two URLs www.BSI.bund.de and www.BSl.bund.de seem to be identical at the first glance at least.

Often users of a fax server no longer bother to check that the fax number entry held in the address book for the recipient is actually correct prior to sending out a fax. The same applies to the assignment of individual recipients to groups. Often no one bothers to check before sending out serial fax transmissions whether the members of a given distribution group are identical with the people to whom the fax should be sent.\nDistribution lists can be used to assign incoming fax transmissions to (several) recipient(s).\nAs long as the possibility that an unauthorised person can alter address books and distribution lists is not ruled out, there is a risk that fax transmissions could be sent to unintended recipients.

In addition to loss of the phone itself, this can result in further financial loss. If an unauthorised person gains possession of a SIM card\n(e.g. because he/she finds it or steals it), he/she can make calls at the expense of the genuine cardholder as long as he/she knows the PIN or can guess it easily.\nData such as telephone directories or short messages which are stored on the mobile phone or SIM card may well be of a confidential nature.

This meant it was possible to make copies of these network providers' SIM cards. However, to do this, the attacker must have the original card. He/she also needs the PIN or, alternatively, the requirement to enter the PIN must be deactivated in order that the IMSI can be read.\nSuch an attack can easily be prevented and detected by private users.

In the simplest case, a mobile phone can be switched on, connected to an interested third party and inconspicuously placed in a room, for example where a meeting is being held. However, as the phone has only a limited battery life and the microphone is not designed for room surveillance, such an attempt at bugging is of only limited effect.\nThrough skilful selection of features and combination of these with additional devices, it is possible to put a mobile phone into talk mode without this being indicated by a ringing tone or other means. For example, there is one type of phone in which the mobile phone's display can be switched off by entering a particular key combination even though a call is actually connected to the device.\nHowever, specially manipulated mobile phones can also be used for this purpose. With these phones, it is not evident from looking at the phone that it is switched on. Here the mobile phone is used as a bugging device which can be activated from anywhere in the world over the telephone network, without this being detectable from the phone itself. Devices in which this special function is implemented using additional circuits are known of. This manipulation is relatively easy to detect through visual inspection after taking the device apart or using special investigation methods.\nOperation of such devices is illegal in Germany.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.96 Tampering with mobile phones", "description": "The installation of additional electronic circuitry, as described in T 5.95 Bugging of indoor conversations over mobile phones, is a typical hardware manipulation. In order so hat such tampering can be carried out, the device to be manipulated must be in the possession of the attacker for a certain period of time.\nAnother way of using mobile phones for bugging purposes is to tamper with the control software\n(firmware) installed on the device. This kind of tampering is a lot more difficult to detect than tampering with the hardware.\nA concealed, undocumented bugging function could already be programmed (either deliberately or by accident) into the control software during development of the device.\nHowever, it is also conceivable that the control software could be modified subsequently by a third party, for example when the device is out of the user's (short-term) control during repair or due to other reasons (loss or theft). Such manipulation requires in-depth specialist expertise which is normally available to few persons other than the firmware developers. It is virtually impossible for an outsider to detect that such manipulation has taken place.\nMobile phones are becoming more flexible through extension of the mobile phone menu functions using SIM Toolkit and a new generation of SIM cards which support this functionality. Such a mobile phone can be programmed with new functions by the service provider over the cellular network. Thus, for example, the card provider can tailor the menu structure to meet the requirements of a particular customer.\nHowever, this capability carries with it the threat that firmware could be tampered with, as the functionality that is needed to reconfigure a phone into a bugging device could already be contained as standard in the firmware. The probability that functions which will convert the mobile phone into a bugging transmitter can be called up from \"outside\" increases.

If a mobile phone is connected to a modem or has an in-built modem, information held on a computer can be transmitted to virtually anywhere in the world wire-free.\nThis type of unauthorised data transfer can be performed either with a mobile phone that has been specially brought along for the purpose or even using an internal mobile phone. In this way, large quantities of data can be passed to the outside world unnoticed. New technologies make the transmission of large quantities of data over mobile phones increasingly attractive. With GSM the maximum data transfer rate is currently 14.4 kbit/s. Recent protocols achieve significantly higher transfer rates. GPRS, for example, allows a transfer rate of 53.6 kbit/s and UMTS a transfer rate of 384 kbit/s.\nNor is it always possible to check afterwards whether such data transmission has occurred as the network provider's record of the call data may already have been deleted.\n", "examples": "* An employee of a company is called out of a meeting with an external person in order to answer an important phone call. The external person uses the short time she is unattended in order to connect the PC installed in the meeting room to his GSM modem. She then initiates a data transfer to a connection of her choice.\n* Where remote access services are used over mobile phone networks, the Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) mechanism is often used as an authentication feature. If the mobile phone is stolen or lost, the authentication procedure will no longer function properly. Although normally a PIN has to be entered when a mobile phone is switched on, most people leave their phones switched on. If the telephone is already switched on when it is stolen, then theoretically it can be used immediately by a third party. If the battery is re-charged in time, the point at which the phone cuts out due to lack of power can be deferred and hence the need to input the PIN because the phone has been switched on again.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.98 Interception of mobile telephone calls", "description": "The easiest way of listening in on a conversation conducted over a mobile phone is simply to listen from close by. It is no rare occurrence to hear a person divulging a lot of company-internal information by talking loudly on the telephone in a public place (see also T 3.45 Inadequate checking of the identity of communication partners).\nBut generally there are also very elaborate technical means available for intercepting telephone calls.\nIf, for example, an attacker can gain access to the technical facilities of the network provider (lines, switching exchanges, base stations), he/she will then be able to listen to any telephone conversation conducted over this equipment. This applies to connections both in the mobile communication network and in the landline network. However, deliberate tapping of conversations which are assigned to a particular call number is extremely effort-intensive, due to the huge flood of data.\nIf the calls are connected over line-connected paths from the base station to the mobile telephone exchange, a physical attack on the cable paths is necessary. If a base station is connected to the mobile telephone exchange over an unencrypted directional radio link, as is the case with some network providers, it is possible to intercept and tap these radio signals unnoticed using antennae and special receivers. The threat is all the greater if all phone calls for the connected base station are transmitted over these directional radio links.\nTelephone conversations are also transmitted bundled over directional radio relay links in the landline network. As these transmissions are generally unencrypted, conversations transmitted by this route can also be tapped with a certain amount of technical effort.\nIn Germany, the transmission of radio signals between mobile phone and base station is encrypted in all GSM mobile communication networks. There are special interception devices around which exploit the weakness of one-sided authentication in the GSM network (the only authentication which occurs is the authentication of the mobile phone to the base station), by pretending to mobile phones to be a base station, disabling encryption and instituting plaintext operation. Depending on the statutory requirements, in some countries encryption of transmissions can be completely disabled. It may also be possible that other security parameters such as the frequency of key changes are weaker.\nOther possible ways of disabling this encryption are tampering with the mobile phone or the technical facilities of the network provider.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.99 Analysis of call data relating to the use of mobile phones", "description": "With mobile communications, the signals transmitted over the transmission route cannot be shielded physically against unauthorised eavesdropping or recording. For this reason, an attacker could execute his/her attack without the access problems common to line-based communication. A second problem which generally occurs with most radio communication services arises from the fact that for technical reasons the mobile communication partners have to be located in order to be contactable. If the devices establish a connection themselves, they also provide information on their location - in the course of establishing the connection. This location information can be used by the network operator or service operator - but also by third parties - to build up movement profiles.\nIf an attacker is familiar with particular filter characteristics over a mobile phone, he/she could\n(although it would be technically effort-intensive) identify individual phone calls by means of these characteristics. These or other attacks require that the customer number (IMSI), mobile transceiver number (IMEI) and subscriber call number (MSISDN) are known.\nAn insider who, for example, had access to the corporate or private telephone directories in a company would be able to identify the MSISDN call number.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.100 Abuse of active contents on access to Lotus Notes/Domino", "description": "In Notes/Domino, it is possible to define active components which are executed following the occurrence of certain events such as the input of data into a particular field.

To this purpose the switch maintains a table that allocates the MAC addresses of the stations on the various ports. Data packets or Ethernet frames that are addressed to a specific MAC address are only forwarded to the port to which the related computer is connected.\nHowever, it is not only the switch that maintains a table with MAC addresses, but also the computers involved. ARP requests can be used to fill these ARP tables at the computer involved.\nThe objective of ARP spoofing is to tamper with these tables (ARP cache poisoning). For this purpose an attacker sends an ARP reply to the victim in which the attacker uses the address of the router that acts as the standard gateway for the related subnet as his/her own MAC address. If the victim then sends a packet to the standard gateway entered, this packet ends up in reality with the attacker. In the same way the ARP cache on the router is also tampered with such that Ethernet frames, which were actually addressed to the victim, in reality end up with the attacker. A series of tools is available on related web sites that makes these methods of attack possible.\nMAC flooding is a method of attack that affects the function of a switch. Switches learn connected MAC addresses dynamically. The MAC addresses are saved in the switching table. In this way, the switch knows which ports the related MAC addresses are connected to.\nIf a large number of packets with different source MAC addresses are sent with the aid of a suitable tool by one of the stations connected, the switch saves these MAC addresses in its switching table. As soon as the storage space for the switching table is full, a switch sends all packets to all switch ports. Due to this \"flooding\" of the switching table with meaningless MAC addresses, a switch can no longer determine which ports actual destination MAC addresses are connected to. This method of attack is used to make it possible to read packets in switched networks.

In this way it is possible to circumvent security mechanisms based solely on the use of a MAC address. However, the attacker must be in the same network segment or even have access to the same switch port as the device that he is attempting to mimic using MAC spoofing.\nA threat due to MAC spoofing also exists on wireless networks (WLAN) on which related access control has been configured on the access point.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.114 Misuse of spanning tree", "description": "The spanning tree protocol is specified in IEEE 802.1d. Spanning tree is used to prevent the formation of loops within a network comprising several switches. With this variant, redundant network structures are identified and a loop-free structure is formed. This measure reduces the active connection paths on any meshed network structure to a tree structure.\nIn the following illustration it can be seen that a port on the bottom switch has been disabled with the aid of spanning tree. By sending out Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs), a root bridge is identified based on the priority set and MAC address of the switch. In the illustration the switch at the top right is the root bridge.\nFigure: Spanning Tree\nSpanning tree does not provide any authentication on the exchange of BPDUs. This situation can be exploited by attackers in switched networks. If an attacker can send BPDUs from a station connected to a switch, the topology will be recalculated with the aid of the spanning tree algorithm. The convergence for the calculation of the topology change can be 30 seconds with spanning tree. In this way, the availability of the network can be seriously affected by sending BPDUs.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.115 Overcoming the boundaries between VLANs", "description": "Virtual LANs (VLANs) are used to logically structure networks. In a VLAN, a logical network structure is formed in a physical network by connecting workstations and servers with similar functions to a virtual network. At the same time a VLAN forms a separate broadcast domain. This means that broadcasts are only distributed within the VLANs. A VLAN can involve an entire switched network and does not need to remain restricted to a single switch.\nThe expansion of VLANs over several switches is carried out using various so-called trunking protocols. Here a physical port is reserved per switch for the inter-switch communication, the logical connection between the switches is termed the trunk. An Ethernet frame is encapsulated in the trunking protocol for the exchange of information between the switches. In this way, the destination switch is able to allocate the information to the related VLAN. IEEE 802.1q and the proprietary protocols ISL (Inter Switch Link) and VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) from the manufacturer Cisco are used as the standards.\nIf an attacker, who is connected to a switch, for example identifies him/herself as a switch by using the trunking protocol ISL (Inter Switch Link) or IEEE 802.1q, it is possible to obtain access to all VLANs configured and therefore to read data that belong to a VLAN; data to which the attacker would not normally have access.\nInformation on configured VLANs is exchanged between Cisco switches with the aid of the proprietary protocol VTP. Here it is possible to distribute the VLAN configuration on a central VTP server to all switches involved within a VTP domain. Although this simplifies the management of VLANs with several switches, at the same time it represents an additional security risk: Although VTP supports authentication within a VTP domain, if a password is not set for the authentication of switches within a domain, an attacker (for example on a dedicated switch configured as a VTP server) can overwrite the entire VLAN architecture on switches in the VTP domain.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.116 Tampering with the z/OS system configuration", "description": "Interaction with z/OS systems is possible via numerous interfaces, such as via the hardware management console, the MVS master console, the enhanced MVS console service, automation processes, remote MVS console and remote maintenance ports. Some security problems which may be related with the use of these interfaces are highlighted below.\nHMC (hardware management console)\nUnauthorised access to the HMC can lead to major security problems. This is because it is possible to change the behaviour of the system during operation from the HMC. It is possible to reinitialise individual LPARs (logical partitions) and even an entire computer group. The HMC can also be used to load new input/output control datasets which are then activated at the next initial program load (IPL). As a result there is a risk, for example, that unrelated disks will be assigned to an LPAR.\nMVS master console\nOne of the ways in which z/OS operating systems are controlled is via MVS consoles. The standard consoles have a fixed connection to the system and do not require an ID or a password. This means that people who have physical access to an MVS console with a high level of authorisation (e.g. to the master console) can enter any MVS command. Unauthorised batch jobs or started tasks can therefore be stopped or started. Furthermore, disks on any system can be placed online if they are generated there. In certain circumstances, it is also possible to regenerate channel paths using MVS commands, and then to append disks that do not belong to this LPAR at all.\nEnhanced MVS console service\nIn addition to the standard MVS consoles, the z/OS operating system provides the EMCS\n(enhanced MVS console service). This is also offered as a function by various applications, such as TSO, CICS or NetView. Dynamic creation of consoles based on a command script job is possible with EMCS; these consoles can support almost all commands including those which can be used on the standard consoles. If EMCS is not protected or only inadequately protected using RACF profiles, it may be possible, in certain circumstances, to tamper with the z/OS operating system from any terminal.\nRisks associated with automation\nAutomation procedures can be programmed to be triggered by messages. If the automation procedures are not specially protected, there is a risk that automation functions could be started without authorisation by generating a fake message.\nRemote MVS console z/OS systems in different locations can be controlled from a central console. Often a software tool is used for this purpose that enables, for example, control of the LPARs in the z/OS systems, even over large distances. The software tool emulates an MVS console on a conventional PC. If the physical or logical access to such control consoles is inadequately protected, there is a risk of unauthorised tampering with remote z/OS systems from the console.\nRemote maintenance ports\nA further threat for the z/OS system can result from incorrect configuration of the RSF console (remote support facility). In certain circumstances, an external attacker can exploit errors in the configuration and dial into this console (see also T 5.10 Abuse of remote maintenance ports).\n", "examples": "* RACF was set up in a computer centre such that RACF commands could also be entered from an MVS master console. An unauthorised employee had access to the room in which these consoles were installed. As a consequence, he allocated the special privilege to his own user ID.

This right may, for instance, have been granted unintentionally due to carelessness in the system administration, or an attacker may have obtained this right, for example by appropriate tampering.\nA further possible method of attacking the system logging is preventing the generation of log data by means of appropriate tampering with the generating components. Which SMF data records are written is, for example, in z/OS entered in a configuration member. By making changes to this member or by setting exits, it is possible to ensure that certain SMF data records are no longer written. The usual security monitors are not able to detect suppressed violations and to report that no SMF records or no system messages are written.\n", "examples": "* In a computer centre, a user managed to deactivate the writing of SMF data records.

A client is connected to the RDP server without checking the authentication of the user beforehand. The entire login screen of the remote desktop is shown directly on the screen of the local client. There is therefore a risk of an attacker gaining remote access to the system by logging in using the Windows RDP.\nInformation on the operating system version and on membership in domains of the Windows servers is available to every remote desktop user without the user having to enter a user name and password. Additional information can be obtained from background images. In many cases, administrators display administration information as a background image, or the server manufacturer has provided a proprietary default background image for pre-installed operating systems. Valuable information can be obtained using this image to analyse the system and exploit the corresponding security gaps.\nWhen the network connection is interrupted during a RDP session, Windows Server 2003 automatically restores the session without requiring the user to log in again as soon as the client is reconnected to the server over the network. The network downtimes can even last minutes in such cases. A higher level of fault tolerance is gained, but at the expense of a threat to the integrity of a\nRDP session. An attacker can gain remote access to the system through social engineering or by tapping the connection. A connection using RDP Version 5.2 in Windows Server 2003 can be easily tapped by third parties and redirected to a new destination without detection. Since the release of Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, you have the ability to secure the connection with SSL, but many clients are not able to establish connections any more, for example Remote Desktop clients from previous Windows versions and RDesktop for Unix/Linux. For this reason, SSL usually cannot be used everywhere to secure communication, and the risk of tapping the connection and of gaining access to the system without authorisation still exists.\nDue the risks and threats described, a higher level of risk must be assumed to exist for the server as soon as RDP is used.\n* An American manufacturer supplied servers with pre-installed OEM versions of Windows Server 2003 to its customers. When a user logs in to the operating system via the console or a remote desktop, a background image with the logo of the manufacturer and a photograph of the server hardware appears. This information could be used to determine which vulnerabilities the system has so they could be exploited for attacks.\n* While the network is down, an administrator leaves an administration PC running an RDP session unsupervised for a short time. If this person is not back on the PC before network operations are restored and the screen saver does not have password protection enabled, then a third party could use the RDP session as soon as the disruption in the network is eliminated. He would then have full administrator privileges and could cause significant damage deliberately or accidentally.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.133 Unauthorized use of web-based administration tools", "description": "Administration using browser-based tools has become increasingly important. One of the decisive advantages for the personnel responsible for technical matters is independence from\n* the operating system platform of the IT system to be administered, and * the location of the IT system to be administered.\nOne thing all tools have in common is that they use critical login data. They depend on standardised authentication methods commonly used on the Internet to ensure the technical personnel have authorised access to the critical local systems. Many administration tools also have their own additional authentication mechanisms or utilise local authentication and security mechanisms, not all of which are standardised. There is a threat of the computer being compromised by unauthorised users.\nA high risk is posed when the security policy for authentication in the network or its implementation in the information system under consideration is undermined by unsuitable authentication procedures for web-based administration tools. The most common causes for this are:\n* selection of the wrong or outdated authentication methods because the particular tool does not support stronger authentication or because other participating IT systems (e.g. security gateways) do not support the favoured protocol.\n* unsuitable implementation or use of web-based authentication in the local authentication system.\nA threat can arise, for example, when the Windows Internet Information Service (IIS) component is activated for the purpose of using web-based administration tools without configuring IIS according to the recommendations. A threat could then be posed when only weak authentication procedures are activated in the standard configuration. It must be pointed out that poor configuration of any web-based administration solution available on the market poses a great risk.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.134 Lack of identification of communication partners", "description": "When using line switching telephony and when using VoIP, the caller can often be identified using his/her telephone number. The called party can then recognise the caller's number in the telephone display without having to take the telephone call. Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) offers the ability to use CLIP (Calling Line Identification Presentation) and COLP (Connected Line Identification Presentation) to transmit the telephone number to the called party's telephone. When using VoIP, this information can be determined using the caller ID. The general term for this function is \"call number display\".\nThe telephone number transmitted is also commonly used for authentication purposes. A commonly implemented example of this mechanism is a function enabling the users to listen to the messages on their answering machine without having to enter their PIN or password.\nAn attacker could assign any telephone number to a telephone by making changes to the switching telephone system, with this number then being transmitted to the called party. The attacker could therefore try to fake his/her identity to the called party (see T 5.42 Social Engineering).\nMany telephones offer an incognito function. The caller can enable this function if he/she wants to prevent their own telephone number from being displayed on the telephone of the called party. The telephone number of the caller must still be transmitted, however, to establish the connection. The telephone exchange to which the telephone of the called party is connected decides if the telephone number will be transmitted to the called party based on this specification. By programming the telephone exchange accordingly, it could be configured to ignore the incognito function without the user knowing it.\nIn homogeneous VoIP networks in which telephone calls are only made via the data network, these problems do not occur in this form, since there is no incognito functionality available. In practice, though, homogeneous VoIP networks are very hard to find. Generally, the local network is connected to a corresponding gateway enabling communication with the users of other telephone systems. For this reason, the problems mentioned above may also occur in the route between the gateway and the telephone of the called party.\nIn the network used for VoIP telephony, the subscribers are identified based on their IP addresses (or MAC addresses). Port-based identification like in a line switching telephone system is not available with VoIP.\nSimilarly to with an email, the caller ID of the sender is transmitted in the signalling information to the recipient of a VoIP call regardless of the sender IP address. The caller ID can be forged just as easily as the sender address of an email. In turn, a forged caller ID may cause the recipient to draw false conclusions regarding the identity of the sender. An attacker could therefore pretend to be another user and make a call to yet another user.\nThe called party could draw false conclusions regarding the identity of the sender due to the forged IP address.\n", "examples": "* By manipulating the telephone system, the telephone number of the managing director of a large-scale company was transmitted by the telephone of an attacker. The attacker uses this manipulation to request certain internal information from an employee who does not know the managing director in person. As this employee thought the caller was the managing director due to the transmitted telephone number, the attacker was provided with all information requested.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.135 SPIT and Vishing", "description": "The use of VoIP offers many possibilities to obtain information or exploit unwitting users under false pretences. Using VoIP, providers can place unwanted advertising for their products or services, for example. SPIT (Spam over IP Telephone), as well as SPAM, which is already a widespread email phenomenon, costs the receivers time and money. Depending on their frequency, SPIT calls are not only a nuisance, but they can also significantly disrupt work flows in an organisation under some circumstances.\nSending SPIT is relatively inexpensive for a provider. If a packet-based connection can be established to a user over the internet, the provider does not incur any additional telephone costs. By dimensioning the internet connection accordingly, the provider can send numerous advertisements at the same time.\nSPIT may just be an advertising slogan, for example. In this case, a recording is played when the person called picks up the phone. This way, products or services can be advertised However, SPIT with fraudulent intentions can also be sent An example of this type of SPIT is Vishing.\nVishing (Voice Phishing) is an attack used to obtain personal information of one or more victims. In this case, a VoIP-based dialler calls a large number of VoIP addresses the attacker has collected. When the call is answered, a voice message is played intended to make the victim believe the call is from a trustworthy organisation, such as the bank where the victim is a customer. During the call, the victim is requested to provide information such as account numbers, PINs, and TANs.\nVishing\nThe term \"Vishing\" means \"Voice Phishing\" or \"Phishing via VoIP\" and describes the organised theft of data via phone by inciting the users, similarly to Phishing (see T 5.157 Phishing and\nPharming), to disclose confidential or financially relevant information by means of well-through stories. Here, both attack preparation and information tapping may be performed via the telephone.\n* Within the framework of one form of Vishing, VoIP-based diallers call a large number of collected VoIP addresses. When the call is answered, a voice message is played intended to make the victim believe the call is from a trustworthy organisation, such as the bank where the victim is a customer. During the call, the victim is requested to provide information such as account numbers, PINs, and TANs.\n* Within the framework of a different attack variant, fraudsters send emails requesting the recipient to call a voice box using a specified phone number by means of well-thought texts. This voice box then retrieves PIN data and other confidential information in a targeted manner. This attack type may be dangerous, because it takes advantage of the advice of many financial institutions to not to react to alleged emails, but to seek contact via the telephone.\nThe aim of Vishing is to mislead as many victims as possible and to prompt them to disclose their access data, passwords, credit card information, etc. This way, fraudsters can collect sufficient information in order to debit money from accounts on behalf of the customer: name, credit card and account number, PIN and TAN numbers.\n", "examples": "* A customer receives an electronic message from his/her bank.

Some of these telephones, for example telephones in printer rooms, can only be accessed by a limited group of people. However, telephones are also often found in parking ramps, access control systems, or areas accessible to visitors.\nIf these telephones contain an electronic telephone book containing internal telephone numbers, there is the risk of such internal telephone numbers being exposed to outsiders.\nWhen VoIP telephones are used in freely accessible areas, additional aspects must be taken into consideration. VoIP telephones consist primarily of software and are often operated in data networks that are also used for other IT applications. An attacker could therefore attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the VoIP software or install malware when he/she has direct access to the device. Softphones in particular are also at risk, because an attacker may attempt to obtain administrator rights on the terminal device or on other IT systems in the same network with the help of a bootable CD-ROM, for example.\nVoIP telephones need to be connected to a data network. An attacker could connect a portable computer to this network connection and may then be able to access the network under some circumstances even though it is protected from the outside by a firewall. He/she could then exploit this access to initiate attacks on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Even an insider could attempt to misuse these connections without having to initiate the attacks from his/her own workstation computer (where such activity would be recorded).\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.137 Analysis of connection data relating to wireless communication", "description": "When using wireless communication, the signals transmitted over the transmission route cannot be shielded physically against unauthorised eavesdropping or recording. For this reason, an attacker could execute his/her attack without the access problems common to line-based communication. In wireless networks using several base stations to support communication in a large area, for example mobile communication networks, it is also common to determine the approximate location of the mobile end devices to ensure they can be accessed quickly. If the devices establish a connection themselves, then they also provide information on their location in the course of establishing the connection. This location information can be used by the network operator or service operator - but also by third parties - to form movement profiles.\n", "examples": "* In WLANs based on IEEE 802.11, the hardware address of a WLAN card, also known as the MAC address, is sent every time data is transmitted. This means that a clear relationship can be established between the MAC address of the wireless client and the time and location of the data transmission.\nIn this manner, movement profiles can be created for mobile users, for example when and where the users log in to public hotspots. Since the MAC address is transmitted in unencrypted form, it is not only possible for the operators of the hotspots to create movement profiles. In principle, anyone who installs a wireless LAN component in a suitable public place can intercept the MAC addresses of other users.\nThe wireless communication of Bluetooth connections can be received passively and recorded with the help of Bluetooth protocol analysers. With knowledge of the device addresses, synchronisation with the frequency hopping sequence can even be performed when the devices are in the \"non- discoverable\" mode. All layers of the Bluetooth protocol stack can be viewed and analysed offline. It is also possible to extract and intercept the transmitted user data (payload) if encryption is not used. Through the use of a directional antenna and suitable electronics to amplify the Bluetooth signal received, this type of eavesdropping can also be performed at an even greater distance than the normal functional range. A transmission output power control is optional and is not supported by every\nBluetooth device.\nThe use of the frequency hopping method alone therefore does not represent a serious obstacle for a well-informed attacker even though it is often written that this makes it significantly more difficult to log in without authorisation or receive and listen in on Bluetooth connections. The reason for using a frequency hopping method is to keep the number of transmission errors due to interference from the operation of other devices (e.g. WLANs) using the same frequency band low, and therefore to ensure a high level of availability.\n* The unique Bluetooth device addresses can be misused to trace the individual devices. By tracing the devices, it is possible to create movement profiles of the users. The device address is not only used to establish a connection, and each data packet contains part of the device address of the master (24 of the 48 bits).\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.138 Attacks on WLAN components", "description": "Security deficiencies in wireless communication, in individual WLAN clients, in access points, or in the distribution system can lead to attacks being successful. In this case, internal data can be read or changed, but WLAN components can also be manipulated so that they in turn can be used as points of entry for attacks on other network and network components.\nIntentionally interfering with the wireless network\nA WLAN can be deliberately disrupted by operating sources of interference, also referred to as jammers. This can lead to the complete failure of a WLAN and therefore represents a denial-of-service attack at the physical level. The source of interference, when it has sufficient transmitting power, can also be located outside of the area in which the WLAN is used.\nSimulating a valid authentication\nAn attacker could record, analyse, and then resend certain control and management signals to simulate a valid authentication of a WLAN component in the WLAN, and therefore obtain unauthorised access to the WLAN.\nSimulating a valid access point\nA man-in-the-middle attack can be performed by smuggling access points into a WLAN from the outside (also referred to as \"cloning\" or an \"evil twin\"). To accomplish this, an additional access point can be installed near a client. If this access point provides the WLAN client with a higher transmitting power than the real access point, then the client will use it as its base station when mutual authentication is not enforced. Furthermore, the official access point may be disabled by a denial-of-service attack. The users then operate in a network that only pretends to be the target network. This makes it possible for an attacker to listen in on communications.\nPoisoning or spoofing methods can also simulate a false identity for an attacker or redirect the network traffic to the systems of the attacker, meaning the attacker can intercept and control communications.\nCompromising the distribution system\nIn addition to connecting an outside access point, it is also possible to compromise the distribution system by inserting an external hub or switch between the access point and distribution system, provided that this area is accessible.\nBy connecting a protocol analyser, all communication between the access point and distribution system can be recorded. Furthermore, using corresponding tools, an active attack on the infrastructure or on a client of the associated access point can be performed. \"Breaking\" the WLAN encryption is not even necessary in this case since data is transmitted completely unencrypted in the LAN section of the distribution system when no encryption mechanisms are used at the application level or protocol level, for example using VPN technologies.\nAttacks on WLAN clients\nWhen a client connects to a WLAN, there are additional threats to the local data on the client. On one hand, attacks could be carried out on WLAN mechanisms, but also on any vulnerabilities of the operating system used. A client manipulated in this manner can lead to the compromising of the entire WLAN, and in the worst case, of the entire IT infrastructure of the organisation.\nWhen data is transmitted in unencrypted form in the WLAN, an attacker can also easily listen in on communications if the data is easily exploitable, as is the case with VoIP voice data, for example.\nThe inadequately planned use of a WLAN client in a wireless network which is not trustworthy (for example a hotspot or ad-hoc network) entails additional dangers. Examples of some of these dangers are listed in the following:\n* With the help of spoofing tools, an attacker could install tools on the client of a WLAN user to compromise the network.\n* An attacker could examine the vulnerabilities of the network services and functions on the client and exploit them under some circumstances. This could then enable the attacker to access the computer if unsuitable passwords are selected or the personal firewall is not configured properly.\nAttacks on access points\nAttacks can also be performed over the clients on other WLAN components, and therefore on the connected network. If there are no security mechanisms for mobile components and transmission standards or they are poorly configured, then attackers could exploit this to gain unauthorised access to the internal network of a government agency or company. Every additional component integrated into a network creates additional network access points which are sometimes difficult to control. Every network connection available has the potential to be misused to eavesdrop on the network.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.139 Tapping of WLAN communication", "description": "Since wireless networks are a shared medium, the data transmitted over a WLAN can be easily recorded.

In spite of the use of encryption, an attacker can still determine the MAC addresses, and therefore the manufacturers, of all stations in the broadcast domain as well as the multicast addresses used, and can therefore obtain information on which Layer 2 protocols are used. When poor encryption is used, the NETBIOS browser messages, and therefore information on the server services in the LAN, are directly accessible.\nWhen encryption is not used or only weak encryption is used, the following information can still be accessed:\n* IP addresses of and ports used by the communication partners in the WLAN * possibly the user data transmitted, provided that this data is not protected at the application level through the use of a VPN, SSL, or some other encryption mechanism.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.140 Evaluation of residual information in printers, copiers, and all-in-one devices", "description": "Many digital copiers, printers, and all-in-one devices are equipped with a large amount of internal storage.

The document is digitized (if it is not already available in digital form), stored in the storage unit of the device, and can then be reproduced directly from there.\nThere are two types of storage used in this case: volatile and non-volatile storage. In volatile storage, the data is deleted as soon as the supply voltage is disconnected. In contrast to volatile storage, the information saved in non-volatile storage is stored permanently, meaning it can also be read even after the device has been switched off. Examples of non-volatile storage are hard disks and flash memory.\nDepending on the method of operation and configuration of the device, the storage contents can be deleted by various events. Deletion may be possible as soon as the next document is read, or maybe only once storage space is needed.\nWhen information is saved in storage, unauthorised persons may be able to access this information under some circumstances. In the simplest case, it may only be possible to print the last document saved. A greater problem is posed when an attacker is able to read out the entire storage device for analysis purposes.\nEven if the stored information is deleted directly after use, it may be possible to reconstruct the data under certain circumstances. Not every device overwrites the deleted data after deletion. Overwriting the storage space used by the deleted data would make restoration of the deleted data significantly more difficult.\nDigital copiers and printers are often only leased.

Within the framework of such an attack, the attacker places himself \"in the middle\" of communications by pretending to be the recipient to the sender and to be the sender to the recipient. First, the attacker redirects a request to establish a connection from the sender to himself. In the next step, the attacker opens a connection to the actual recipient of the message. If the attacker is able to do this, he may be able to read or manipulate all information sent by the sender to the supposed recipient before forwarding it to the correct recipient. In turn, the attacker may be able to intercept the reply from the recipient if the corresponding protection mechanisms are not in effect.\nThe most difficult part of a man-in-the-middle attack for the attacker is usually redirecting the request to establish a connection to himself. This part of the attack can be initiated using corresponding methods, for example spoofing or DNS manipulations.\nEven encrypted connections cannot always provide protection against man-in-the-middle attacks. If the identity of the communication partner is not checked or is falsified, an encrypted connection could be established between the sender and the attacker and between the attacker and the recipient.

A user subsequently wants to establish a connection to the web server of the bank for the purpose of home banking. To determine the IP address of the bank's web server and establish the connection, the user's computer sends a query with the name of the bank's computer to the DNS server, which then replies with the falsified IP address of the attacker. The user then establishes an https connection to the computer of the attacker using the falsified IP address. The browser displays a warning that the SSL certificate is invalid, but the user ignores this warning because he does not understand why the warning appears. As a result, the user is redirected to the web server of the attacker. The attacker then opens an encrypted https connection to the bank. The attacker can then read and manipulate all transactions performed by the user in the subsequent web session.\n* To perform man-in-the-middle attacks in a WLAN, an attacker could smuggle additional access points into the WLAN (referred to as \"clones\" or \"evil twins\").

Circumventing the authentication methods can therefore result in the compromising of the entire directory service.\nAnother risk is that unauthorised persons will be able to access network resources or services by extensions of authorisations. This can lead to the complete penetration of all defences of the directory service by an attacker. The affected system could then be impaired or could even be destroyed. Examples of scenarios in this context include the unauthorised acquisition of unlimited rights or spoofing an identity with more rights than the user's own rights in order to obtain more extensive authorisations.\nIf a third party is able to use a directory service without authorisation, then a wide variety of different types of damage can result. Examples of such damage include the following:\n* If an attacker is able to use a directory service without authorisation, then he could read secret keys, change the keys, use the keys of a certification authority in the directory service, or manipulate critical security parameters. The cryptographic methods used would not provide the expected level of security any more as a result of this, which means the confidentiality or integrity of the data protected by encryption cannot be guaranteed any more either.\n* If the directory service is intended to be used for login procedures and authorisation is valid universally in the network once the identity of the user has been determined, then unauthorised authentications can threaten additional resources, and especially the other systems in the network. It is therefore possible for additional systems to become compromised once the directory service has been compromised. A directory service can be used to grant users (after just one authentication) rights to other systems that would only be obtained without directory service after authenticating themselves on these systems. In this case, it is also possible for these systems to become compromised once the directory service has been compromised.\nThe security of a directory service can also be threatened when anonymous users are allowed. Since their identity is not checked, anonymous users are initially able to send any query to the directory service and obtain at least some information on the structure and content of the directory service. If anonymous binds (with LDAP) to the directory service are not possible (except for authentication itself), then the requests are usually replied to with an error message because otherwise attackers will obtain at least some information on the directory service. This information can then be used to prepare for further attacks.\nThis is the case especially when information on resources in the network and on the network itself is disclosed.\nIf anonymous access is permitted, then it will also be easier for attackers to conduct DoS attacks on the directory service because they will have access capabilities that are more difficult to control.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.145 Manipulation of data and tools for patch and change management", "description": "Patch and change management normally act from a central location.

For this reason, many operating systems move (swap) the parts of the memory currently not in use to the hard disk.\nThis data is swapped to a storage area referred to as the swap file or the swap partition (or just\n\"swap\" for short), although the term \"swap file\" was coined primarily by Microsoft for Windows operating system (otherwise also referred to as \"paging file\"). The operating system manages the swap file automatically and adjusts its size according to the amount of storage space needed. If a process requires more storage space to execute, then the size of the swap file increases. As soon as less storage space is needed (for example because applications were terminated), the swap file decreases in size. Defining the size of the swap file in advance accelerates Windows so you can work faster, especially in cases where the computer does not have much main memory.\nThe swap files are not deleted automatically when a user logs out of the system or the system is shut down. For this reason, some of the information used by the user while working on the IT system is still located in the swap file. This information can also include sensitive data such as passwords or cryptographic keys. The protection of the data is therefore not guaranteed because it would be possible, for example, to bypass all access controls and read this information by removing the hard disk and installing it in another computer.\n", "examples": "Some users in a company complained that it took too long to shut down their clients. For this reason, the administrator responsible set the corresponding DWORD value to 0 so that the swap files would not be deleted automatically any more when shutting down the clients.\nA short time after a laptop containing important corporate data had disappeared on a business trip, internal company information was published on a non-company web site. This raises the suspicion that an unauthorised person was able to read the critical data and start the system.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.147 Unauthorised reading or disturbance of the virtualisation network", "description": "Manifold network connections are required in order to operate a virtual infrastructure. These connections are used in order to be able to access storage networks. Moreover, the connections between the individual virtualisation servers are required in order to allow for controlling and monitoring of the virtualisation servers and the virtual IT systems. For high-availability functions or the so-called Live Migration (migration of virtual IT systems between virtualisation servers during live operations), network connections are required as well. These network connections are referred to as \"virtualisation network\" in the following.\nWithin a virtual infrastructure, individual virtual IT systems can be migrated between virtualisation servers (Live Migration). For example, this is performed for load balancing, for maintenance purposes, or to compensate a failure. Here, the processor condition and the main memory content, as well as the configuration data of the virtual IT system must be transferred from one virtualisation server to the other. This transmission is performed using the so-called virtualisation network. The transmission protocols used by the manufacturers of the virtualisation solutions often do not provide for any encryption mechanisms for this flow of data. Because of this, persons who gain unauthorised access to the virtualisation network are able to read confidential content of the transferred guest systems such as the main memory content. For example, confidential data contained in the main memory that is otherwise only transmitted through the network in an encrypted manner may be read and possibly even changed. If the virtualisation servers use a central storage network, the content of the connected storage network may possibly also be compromised (see also T 5.129 Manipulation of data via the storage system, as well as T 5.7 Line tapping and T 5.8 Manipulation of lines).\nA manipulated virtualisation server may furthermore disturb the virtualisation network by the attacker accessing the information transmitted in the network and suppressing or modifying network packets. For example, changes to the main memory content of a virtual IT system may not be checked by the virtualisation server when it is transmitted during a Live Migration. In this way, main memory content of the guest system could be modified by an attacker.\nIf the communication in the virtualisation network is disrupted, migrations during live operations may fail. This may result in resource bottlenecks in the virtual infrastructure if these migrations were initiated to prevent these bottlenecks.\n", "examples": "A medium-sized company uses a database server for processing the personnel data of its employees. In order to protect this personnel data, the database content is only written to the hard disks of the database server in an encrypted form. The client application used by the Personnel Department users also communicates with the database server in an encrypted manner. However, the database system itself partially stores the data in an unencrypted form in its main memory during processing.\nThis database system has been virtualised within the framework of the virtualisation project in the company. The administrator of the virtualisation server now wants to access salary data of the personnel database in order to improve her position during salary negotiations, since she feels that she is underpaid when compared to her colleagues. She designed the database system and therefore knows how the system works. However, she is not able to use functions or the server or the database software in order to unobtrusively access the system's data. Therefore, she installs a network monitoring tool in the virtualisation network which she can use to read the network traffic in this network.\nShe now orders the virtualisation servers to migrate the database server between two servers during live operations (Live Migration). She reads and records the transmission of the main memory in the network. After several recorded migrations, she is able to reconstruct a complete copy of the salary table from the recorded content of the database server's main memory.\nThis attack on the confidentiality of the data in the personnel administration remains unnoticed, since the Live Migration is completely transparent for the database system and the client application.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.148 Misuse of virtualisation functions", "description": "The majority of the virtualisation products contain tools for freezing virtual machines or certain conditions of the virtual machines. These functions are normally based on the hard disk containers of the virtual IT systems being copied or the conditions of the internal memory and the processor of the virtual IT system being stored to a bulk memory of the virtualisation server.\nEvery virtualisation server has access to all storage resources of the virtual machines it administrates. There is therefore a risk that the virtualisation server may access such resources in an unauthorised manner in order to copy or modify data without authorisation. Therefore, an attacker may easily produce a copy of a virtual machine in order to remove this copy from the computer centre and to operate it on a separate virtualisation server without authorisation. The attacker may use the created copy in order to examine the virtual machine.\nFurthermore, an unmodified clone of a virtual machine may cause an IP address or other resource conflict in computer centre operations if such a clone is not adapted before booting.\nFor some virtualisation products, snapshots of a virtual machine may also be created during live operations. In this case, the processor condition and the main memory content are written to a hard disk of the virtualisation server. Moreover, the hard disk container of the virtual machine is also frozen and changes are written to a differential file. This data may be copied in order to create an operable clone of the virtual machine with the help of another virtualisation server. The stored content of the processor condition and the main memory of the virtual machine may furthermore be used by an attacker in order to analyse storage areas of the virtual machine. For example, keys of encryption tools stored in the main memory of the virtual machine without any encryption may be extracted at this point.\nFurthermore, it is possible to reset virtual machines to an old status by using snapshots. This way, safeguards taken in order to close security gaps may be undermined, for example.\nAttacks otherwise recorded in the log files of the virtual machines may also be concealed by resetting a virtual machine to a snapshot. Together with the status of the virtual machine, its log file is reset as well.\nIf older snapshots are activated, it is also possible to restore data that should be deleted. If the virtual IT system is reset to the snapshot, supposedly deleted data may be restored. The use of tools which overwrite the content of a file several times in order to render the restoration impossible is not efficient either if a snapshot was created before the tool is used within the virtual IT system. If a snapshot has been created for a virtual machine, the overwriting processes only affect the differential file containing the changes performed since the snapshot was created. If the snapshot is deleted and the changes in the differential file are applied to the hard disk container, the seemingly multiple overwriting processes are only written to the hard disk container once.\n", "examples": "In the computer centre of a company operating in the field of basic research, data with a high protection requirements category regarding confidentiality are processed in a virtual IT system.\nTherefore, a hard disk encryption program is installed in the virtual machine. This requires the entry of a password during booting. The password was only disclosed to a few, particularly trustworthy employees of the company.\nThe hard disk encryption program works transparently for the operating system of the virtual machine. This means no additional password must be entered during operation of the virtual machine.\nDuring operation of the virtual machine, the data is protected by restricted authorisations.\nMoreover, user accounts are blocked automatically if these are used several times to try to gain unauthorised access to the data.\nBy using the hard disk encryption program, the data of the virtual machine is protected in the storage network. The computer centre operator therefore assumes that copying the hard disk container of the virtual machine does not result in any data useful to an attacker. Moreover, the operator believes that a sufficient level of security has been achieved by assigning authorisations and automatically blocking accounts.\nAn employee of this computer centre is in a financial difficulty. A competitor of the computer centre operator now offers the employee a large amount of money if he provides the competitor with access to the data processed in the virtual machine.\nAs a consequence, the employee creates a snapshot of the virtual machine during live operations on the virtualisation server. The snapshot contains the internal memory content, as well as the processor condition of the virtual IT system. The employee copies the configuration file, the hard disk containers, the content of the internal memory, and the CPU condition of the virtual machine to a portable mass storage medium and leaves the organisation with this medium.\nThe copy of the virtual machine can now be executed on the virtualisation server of the competitor. Since the virtualisation server restores the runtime environment of the virtual machine from the stored data, the hard disk encryption program does not prompt the user to enter a password. The operating system in the virtual machine does not \"notice\" this interruption of operations.\nThe attacker tries to determine the passwords of the authorised users with the help of brute-force attacks. In order to accelerate the procedure, the attacker creates several copies of the virtual machine. If an account is blocked due to the number of failed attempts, the attacker resets the virtual machine to the condition before the account was blocked and continues the brute-force attack.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.149 Misuse of guest tools in virtual IT systems", "description": "For many virtualisation products, so-called guest tools are installed in the virtual IT systems. On the one hand, these guest tools can be used to provide the device drivers required for operating system virtualisation for virtual or emulated devices such as network cards, graphics cards, or hard disks. On the other hand, these tools can be used to install programs for communicating with the hypervisor or the host operating system, for improving the performance of the virtual IT system, and for simplifying the provision of new virtual IT systems within the virtual IT systems. With the help of the guest tools, the virtual systems may additionally be monitored. The hypervisor or the host operating system uses guest tools to monitor the availability and performance of the guest.\nThe guest tools are frequently executed with high authorisations due to their quasi-system function. Frequently, they are executed in the context and therefore with the rights of the operating system core of the virtual machine.\nFunctions such as overbooking main memory or bulk memory space for virtual IT systems are coordinated between the hypervisor and the virtual IT system with the help of guest tools. These functions constitute a significant added value for the virtualisation technology in computer centre operations.\nFor some virtualisation products specialised for software development, there is additionally the option of conveniently designing complex test scenarios. This is also frequently implemented or supported with the help of the guest tools. For this, the guest tools are equipped with interfaces in order to transmit script files to virtual IT systems. These scripts can then also be executed in the virtual IT system using the guest tools. All script languages available in the virtual IT system may be used. The scripts may be started either during system start, when a user logs in, or also at any other time. The interfaces do not normally require any network connection between the guest systems, but are provided by the hypervisor or the host operating system.\nThese interfaces for scripts may be exploited by an attacker in order to establish an undesirable communication across several virtual systems that cannot be controlled with the help of classical means. In this, the attacker transmits the data using the interface for transporting script files.\nFurthermore, when using the described virtualisation products designed for software development, an attacker may transmit proprietary script files from one virtual IT system to another virtual IT system with the help of the guest tools. These scripts can be executed with the rights needed to run the guest tools. Due to the wide-ranging authorisation of the guest tools, this is particularly critical, since any actions may be performed with the guest tools in the guest system concerned. For example, malware can be started, users can be created, group memberships can be modified, or the configuration of the operating system of the virtual IT system can be manipulated.\nDenial-of-service by overbooking resources\nSome virtualisation products allow overbooking of different resources such as hard disk space or\nRAM. For example, if two virtual IT systems compete for internal memory capacity, the host operating system or a hypervisor may order the guest tools to reserve virtual RAM in one of the virtual IT systems. The physical representation of this storage is not used by the virtual IT system as a consequence. The hypervisor may now provide this physical storage to the other virtual IT system as virtual RAM. The other way around, a virtual IT system may use the guest tools to request main memory capacity.\nIf an attacker controls a virtual IT system, he/she may request main memory space with the help of malware to the extent that the main memory space would become scarce for other virtual IT systems. This has adverse effects on the capability of the other virtual IT systems through to a denial-of-service attack. The same effect occurs if an attacker accesses a service of a virtual IT system from the outside in such a way that this service occupies large amounts of storage space.\nIf a function for overbooking hard disk space is used, there is usually also an option for releasing this storage. This is performed by consolidating unused disk space and by highlighting this disk space as free.\nIf an attacker triggers such a process in a virtual IT system, the storage systems are put under significant stress. This may also reduce the capability of other IT systems.\n", "examples": "* A computer retailer processes software development jobs for different customers. For this, the computer retailer operates a virtualisation environment specialised for development assignments, since comprehensive test scenarios must be established for the development of client/server applications. The test systems for these scenarios are provided with the help of several templates for different virtual servers and clients that are copied and adapted to the respective test scenario if required.\nDue to the weak order situation of the computer retailer, several developers must be dismissed. One of the dismissed developers wants to take revenge for her dismissal and develops a script which continuously resets a virtual test system to the initial condition of the template once a user logs in to the virtual system for the second time. It looks as if the user who logged in triggered the reset. In reality, this script is entered into the test system once it is started for the second time with the help of the virtualisation software.\nAdditionally, the script transmits itself to every virtual test system running in the virtual infrastructure via a virtualisation function.\nThe persons responsible at computer retailer assume that their systems are infested with a worm and commission an IT consulting company with a network analysis in order to determine the cause of the problem. However, the consulting company cannot identify any irregularities in the network of the computer retailer. Only by accident, one of the developers notices the attack to the test environment performed by his colleague.\nTroubleshooting and failure of test operations required significant personnel resources and caused the non-observance of deadlines. Thus, the computer retailer which was already in a precarious financial situation suffered additional damage.\n* A service provider operates a web server farm for several customers. In order to save hardware cost, the web servers are virtualised. In doing so, the service provider provides the virtual systems of the customers with significantly more main memory than actually present in the virtual infrastructure. Since the web servers of the customers are normally only utilised insignificantly, there are no perceivable performance limitations in the virtual systems.\nOne of the web servers of the customers then suffers a denial-of-service attack. In this, this virtual IT system consumes very large amounts of the main memory. However, this memory is not freely available in the physical virtualisation server the virtual web server is operated on, but is used by other virtual web servers. In order to be able to provide the attacked system with this memory space, this space must be released by the other virtual IT systems. The hypervisor of the virtualisation server therefore reduces the main memory for all other virtual web servers controlled by it. As a consequence, the response times of the virtual web servers increase significantly. Some of the connections are interrupted so that even the virtual web servers that were not the direct aim of the DoS attack are no longer available.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.150 Compromising the hypervisor of virtual IT systems", "description": "The hypervisor is the central component of a virtualisation server and it controls all virtual machines executed on this virtualisation server. It assigns processor and main memory resources and distributes the available computation time to the virtual machines. Furthermore, it manages the access of the virtual IT systems to the network and the storage resources. A successful attack to this component means the loss of control of all virtual IT systems executed in the context of this hypervisor. An attack on a hypervisor may predominantly be performed as follows:\n* Manipulation of the CPU registers controlling the virtualisation functions for processors with integrated virtualisation support. Such attacks may be used to determine whether the attacker is in a virtual environment. For some virtualisation products, the hypervisor itself may be visualised and therefore controlled by malware by certain processor commands. This is even possible from a virtual IT system.\n* Utilisation of an error in the implementation of the resources provided to the virtual IT systems by the hypervisor. For example, this may refer to emulated network cards, bulk storage media, or graphics cards. For some virtualisation products, core components such as processor and main memory are also emulated. The device emulations are used by the virtual IT systems in order to use the corresponding functions of the hypervisor and/or the host operating system.\n* As a central component, the hypervisor assumes a host of security-critical functions on a virtualisation solution. If an attacker manages to compromise the hypervisor, secure operation of the respective virtual IT systems and the respective virtualisation servers is particularly endangered. Attackers may attempt to manipulate or disturb virtual IT systems in this way. Confidential information could be disclosed to unauthorised persons in this way. Weaknesses in the hypervisor product used may therefore entail significant risks for information processing.\n* Some virtualisation systems furthermore include functions for communication between hypervisor and virtual IT systems. These are normally implemented by guest tools installed in the virtual IT system. In order to allow for communication between the guest tools and the hypervisor, every virtual IT system is equipped with a communication channel for the guest tools to the hypervisor. For this, there is a specific DMA channel in virtual IT systems based on the products provided by the manufacturer VMware opening such a channel if certain processor registers with certain values are loaded. This option is not exclusively available for guest tools, but also for malware. If an attacker is able to occupy this communication channel, he/she may exploit security gaps or design weaknesses of the hypervisor in order to gain control of the hypervisor or to his/her own code in the context of the hypervisor. In this way, the attacker may gain control of other virtual IT systems. Since the hypervisor monitors and controls all functions of a virtual IT system, the hypervisor can be used to directly manipulate processor functions or main memory content of the virtual IT system in order to introduce malware into the virtual IT system. This does not necessarily require a usable security gap in the virtual IT system attacked using the hypervisor.\n", "examples": "A computer centre service provider operates IT systems for several customers competing with each other. In order to reduce the system operation costs for the customers and to stay competitive, the service provider introduces a virtualisation solution in its computer centre operations. The service provider informs its customers about the fact that their systems are now operated as virtual IT systems. Since the network of the computer centre service provider is designed in such a way that no communication connections can be established between the IT systems of different customers using the network, the service provider continues to guarantee that the confidentiality of the customers' data is ensured. The service provider checks this with the help of regular audits and also provides its customers with audit possibilities.\nA database administrator of one of the customers is provided with the option of interactively logging in to the IT systems operated by the computer centre service provider. He has administrator rights on the database system. Hoping to gain information about a competitor of his/her employer, he now starts malware allowing him to execute his own code in the context of the hypervisor due to an error in the graphics card emulation of the hypervisor. This code allows for monitoring all hypervisor functions. In this way, he is able to identify a database system of another customer of the computer centre service provider as a database system of a direct competitor. Using the bulk memory interface of the hypervisor, he manages to read data from and modify content in the database of this virtual machine. This significantly disrupts the production of the competitor and the company of the administrator is provided with a competitive advantage.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.151 DNS flooding - denial-of-service attacks", "description": "A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is used to prevent legitimate users of IT systems from using their systems. In this case, limited resources such as the CPU computing time, memory (RAM), disk space, network bandwidth or the like are deliberately overloaded.\nWhen a DoS attack on a DNS server is carried out, so many requests are sent to this server that the network connection to the DNS server and/or the DNS server itself will become overloaded. In general, the requests are sent using a bot network to achieve the required volume of data traffic. Since a DNS server is virtually \"flooded\" with requests when this form of attack is performed, it is also known as \"DNS flooding\". A DNS server that has become overloaded in this manner can no longer respond to any legitimate requests. In general, all DNS servers responsible for the domain are attacked; thus the names of this domain can no longer be resolved.\n", "examples": "* Two companies have designed and developed very similar products and are thus in direct competition. Each company sells its product using its respective company web shop. Measured in item-based sales, one company lags far behind the other company. In order to make up for this disadvantage, the company with the lower sales figures decides to have a DoS attack carried out against the DNS server of the competitors. Thus, the domain name of the attacked company's web shop can no longer be resolved. Interested customers will fail when trying to establish a connection attempt, because the DNS servers can no longer process any requests due to the overload. The lost business and the damage to the reputation constitute a significant damage for the victim.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.152 DNS hijacking", "description": "DNS hijacking is a method of attack used to route the communications between advertising DNS servers and resolvers via the IT system of an attacker. It is thus a man-in-the-middle attack.\nCommunications do not take place directly between the two communication partners, but are routed via a third party.\nThe attacker can now listen in on and record communications. The far greater risk, however, is that a successful attacker is able to change any traffic of the two communication partners in any way. An attacker is thus able to:\n* reject packets,\n* modify or (re)direct packets or * send his/her own response packets.\nIf a request is sent by the resolver of a client IT system to a DNS server after a DNS hijacking attack has been completed successfully, then the attacker can, for example, modify the allocation of name and IP address according to his/her wishes and needs, regardless of whether it is an advertising or a resolving DNS server.\nDNS hijacking can also be combined with other forms of attack; phishing in particular is ideal in this case. When phishing (derived from \"password\" and \"fishing\") is carried out, passwords or similar information are elicited from users (for example, see also T 5.42 Social Engineering and T\n5.78 DNS spoofing) in order to sell this data or to use them for one's own advantage.\n", "examples": "* A company operates its own web shop and a customer wants to shop there. An attacker succeeds in routing the customer and company's entire DNS traffic via his server. The customer enters the domain name of the web shop in his browser. Usually, the name is automatically resolved into the corresponding IP address in the background. Since, however, the attacker is interposed, she rejects the DNS request and sends her own response packet. Here, the attacker changes the allocation of IP address and name so that the customer is not redirected to the company's web shop, but to the attacker's web shop. The attacker's web shop is a visual reconstruction of the web shop of the desired company and so the customer does not notice any difference. The customer enters his login data and, following his purchase, his credit card number, which he has thus disclosed to the attacker. As a result, the attacker can use the data in order either to make purchases at the customer's costs or to resell the data obtained.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.153 DNS amplification attack", "description": "A DNS amplification attack is a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack). When a DoS attack is carried out, the attacker tries to set one or several services in a state in which they cannot be operated due to overload. As compared to DNS flooding (T 5.151 DNS flooding - denial-of-service), the target in this case is not the DNS server to which the requests are sent, but the recipient of the responses.\nThe fact that certain requests generate a relatively large amount of response data is taken advantage of. Here, it is possible to achieve an amplification factor of 50 and higher. This means that the response, measured in bytes, is 50 times larger than the request. Due to the number and size of the responses, the network bandwidth and/or the computer itself will become overloaded beyond their performance capacity. Thus, any technical IT component can be the target of the attack.\n", "examples": "* A company (the target of the attack) operates a central security gateway. This security gateway is the only connection point between the internal network and the Internet. Now, the attacker misuses the DNS servers of several companies to carry out a DNS amplification attack against the security gateway of the attack's target. For this purpose, the attacker uses a bot network to continuously generate a large amount of requests. In addition to this, the attacker uses IP spoofing (T 5.48 IP spoofing) in order to enter the IP address of the security gateway as sender address; thus, all responses are sent to this address. Due to the large amount of data, the security gateway will become overloaded, which means that the company attacked is cut off from the Internet. A possible side-effect is that the DNS servers requested will become overloaded.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.154 DNS information leakage", "description": "The main function of DNS is to resolve names and IP addresses. In order to meet these requirements, the allocation of names and IP addresses of all computers and network components of DNS servers is stored, amongst other things. Part of this information must be published:\n* DNS servers * Web servers * Mail servers * File servers * VPN connection points\nIf this domain information was not freely accessible by the public, it would not be possible to establish connections to these servers using domain names via the Internet. Domain information on internal computers and network components, however, are usually not intended for the public and should thus remain internal information within the organisation. Since domain information says something about the function and/or location of the respective IT component in most cases, situations in which such information is published are referred to as DNS information leakage.\nPublication itself does not constitute direct damage to the information system. However, the domain information obtained can be used to prepare for an attack on the information system. An attacker can gain on overview of the network, security-related components and worthwhile targets. The more information on the target of an attack an attacker can collect, the higher the chances that he/she will find a vulnerability.\nThere are several approaches for information leakage:\n* If the visibility of the domain information is not restricted, all the domain information can be requested legitimately.\n* If there are no restrictions regarding zone transfers (T 3.104 Incorrect configuration of a DNS server), all the domain information can be queried by means of a single query.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.155 Exploitation of dynamic DNS updates", "description": "Dynamic updates are used to modify, add or delete data of the domain name space in an automated manner.

In general, this is achieved by using dynamic updates.\nHowever, there is the risk of possible misuse of dynamic updates. Domain information is changed in an automated manner; the security is thus based on the trustworthiness of those computers which are allowed to carry out dynamic updates as well as on the rules defining what may be modified. If dynamic updates of any source are accepted, each host can change the domain information as they wish. An attacker can thus manipulate all services requiring DNS. Furthermore, a combination with attacks such as phishing, infection with malicious software (malware) etc. is very unlikely.\n", "examples": "* An attacker has found out that the DNS servers of a company unconditionally accept dynamic updates due to an error in the configuration. The attacker exploits this knowledge and manipulates the domain information in such a way that the company's entire e-mail traffic is routed via his mail server.

In addition, he manipulates the domain information in such a manner that any connection to the company's Intranet and web server is redirected to the attacker's web server. There, the attacker tries to infect the computers with malware and integrate them into his bot network.

By combining many bots, a bot network is formed.\nBot networks are used for a number of illegal activities. Fields of application of bot networks include sending masses of spam e-mails or e-mails with malicious attachments and links (e.g. for phishing) but also logging keyboard strokes (keylogging) and thus misappropriation or theft of personal information (such as passwords, PINs, etc.) or confidential business information (corporate espionage). Moreover, bots enable the misuse of infected computers by storing illegal software on them or even using the infected computers to make such software available, for example, by means of file sharing. A form of attack which is particularly serious for networks and services are so-called DDoS attacks (DDoS, Distributed Denial of Service). DDoS attacks are carried out for political, ideological, but mainly for financial reasons.\nA simplified typical bot network structure is as follows:\n* The bot master (also bot herder) develops a bot client. He/she infects the PC of an end user via the internet by exploiting an existing security gap.\n* The bot client establishes a connection with the command and control server (C&C server).\n* The bot master updates the bot client with new attacks and instructions.\n* The bot scans a random IP address range for vulnerabilities and infects other computers.\n* The infected computers establish a connection to the command and control server themselves and receive commands.\nMechanism for infection and distribution\nIn the past, infection of a PC with bots was mainly carried out by exploiting known security gaps in system services and applications. For example, the worms SDBot and Agobot were equipped with scan routines in order to detect security gaps in unprotected systems. SDBot is distributed by exploiting the following security gaps, among others: NetBIOS (port 139), NTPass (port 445),\nDCOM (ports 135 and 1025), and WebDav (port 80). Agobot has an exploit framework for exploiting vulnerabilities of remote services (e.g. ports 135 and 445). In addition, Agobot searches for backdoors left behind by other malicious programs, e.g. by Bagle on port 2745.\nAn effective infection method from the point of view of the attacker is the use of social engineering in order to entice users to perform a spontaneous thoughtless action such as clicking on manipulated links in e-mails or instant messaging messages or executing e-mail attachments. Many bugs are also distributed by means of file sharing (peer-to-peer networks). Recently, it is increasingly common for legitimate and highly frequented websites to be manipulated and misused as a distribution point for malware by inserting script code in the website in order to automatically install malware on the user's computer (drive by download or drive by infection).\nAnother important aspect when considering bot networks is their communication and control structure. In most cases, they are controlled via one or several command and control servers.\nCentrally controlled bot networks are easy to develop and administer. However, blocking of the few command and control servers results in the inability to use the bot network. To protect the bot networks from being discovered and deactivated, other communication models such as peer-to-peer protocols (due to their decentralised architecture) and HTTP as well as masking techniques such as compression, encryption, and fast fluxing are increasingly being used.\n", "examples": "* The Zeus bot network consisted of more than 100,000 hijacked computers, mainly in Spain and Poland, and was built using the low-cost bot network tool kit Zeus. The Zeus bot network primarily collected financial data such as account and credit card details and other confidential information. It was controlled centrally by a server. In April 2009, this server sent a \"Kill Operating System\" command which caused important entries in the Windows registry file of all computers connected to the bot network to be deleted and the virtual memory of Windows to be overwritten with zeros. As a consequence, the operating system could no longer be started and so the computers had to be reinstalled completely.\n* Torpig is a Trojan horse which infects Windows operating systems and combines the corresponding computers into a bot network. In 2006, Torpig was sent as an executable file via e-mail; nowadays it is also distributed as script code on websites. The individual infected computers used random elements and search results from Twitter posts to generate their own domain names which were then used for reloading malicious code and updates. The task of the bot network was to spy out data for bank accounts, credit cards, and FTP accounts. The collected information was transmitted to a central server.\nIn early 2009, scientists were able to record and examine the data traffic of the bot network for around 10 days. According to this, Torpig spied out data of more than 300,000 different accounts, including bank account details and credit card details of various financial institutions.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.157 Phishing and pharming", "description": "Phishing\nPhishing is a combination of the words \"password\" and \"fishing\" and refers to attacks where passwords, credit card data, or other confidential information is elicited from users. To accomplish this, methods of social engineering in combination with identity theft are frequently used. For example, the attackers send cleverly worded e-mails to the users.\nIf the victim believes he/she knows the sender and considers him/her trustworthy, in most cases the victim will also consider the e-mail trustworthy and carry out the steps described in it, for example, open a link or attachment included in the e-mail.\nOther forms of phishing use specialised malware which is sent directly to the users or placed on the victims' computers by indirect methods.\n", "examples": "* Many online banking users received e-mails that apparently came from the Service department of their bank. In the e-mail, they were informed that, due to changes to the services, they needed to log in to the web site specified using their standard banking password and enable the new services using a TAN. The web site looked authentic, but had nothing to do with the bank mentioned in the e-mail. Instead, the web site was prepared by attackers and placed on the Internet. The only purpose of the web site was to enable the attackers to collect access data to other people's accounts.\nSimilar attacks have also been conducted on the users of popular eCommerce and auction web sites.\nPharming\nPharming refers to the manipulation of the name resolution of Internet domain names in order to divert client accesses to forged servers. For example, this can enable an attacker to make a forged web site be displayed in the victim's browser instead of the actually requested site. The pharming approach is based on phishing. The term \"pharming\" is derived from the words \"phishing\" and\n\"farming\".\nFrom a technical point of view, there are several ways the attacker can achieve the manipulation of the name resolution, for example:\n* Attackers can forge DNS information on DNS servers by exploiting vulnerabilities or faulty configurations.\n* Attackers can insert false DNS information in DNS caches (DNS cache poisoning).\n* Malware can be used to modify the \"hosts\" file on the client.\n* Unauthorised changes to the configuration of routers can be implemented, for example, if the passwords of the devices are weak.\nBy means of pharming, an attacker could assign the IP address of a false server to the computer name used for an internet banking server and then redirect requests from the user to this server. In many cases, the web sites created on the false servers for such attacks are visually identical to the original web site, and so the users do not become suspicious.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.158 Abuse of social networks", "description": "Social networks are very successful platforms that are attracting more and more members.\nHowever, besides various advantages, there are also certain security risks which the users should not loose sight of:\n* The identity used by users in social networks or virtual worlds (e.g. user profile or avatar) is often closely connected to the users' real identity. Other persons may be able to misuse a virtual identity, for example, by performing actions in this role under false pretence without the owner being aware of this.\n* Users of social networks disclose a large amount of information about themselves in order to be noticed and to be able to participate in these networks. Depending on the intention of the social network, this may be the name and photo of the user, one or several e-mail addresses, place of residence, employer as well as personal background and professional history. This information is accessible to large groups of users and the user can no longer control its distribution.\n* Information on users can be used as a basis for social engineering attacks. The aim of such attackers is to gather as much background information as possible in order to obtain the victim's trust and to convince the victim to execute further actions, e.g. to open certain files.\n* Confidential information can be disclosed, for example, because the general idea of a \"social network\" reflects close relationships and trust between the participants which does not always exist.\n* The data accessible via social networks can be used for skilful guessing of passwords. Typically, data such as date of birth, place of birth, schools, universities visited, and places of work are already provided upon registration with such services in order to establish interesting contacts. Nowadays, many Internet providers and applications directly register personal information upon assignment of passwords which is queried in case someone has forgotten their password. For example, in telephone banking, it is often sufficient to know the correct date of birth, which can be easily found out via social networks.\nExample\n\"Evil twin\": A social network was used by a data phisher to create a forged profile of a celebrity.\nDue to the publicly available images and the quick creation of a seemingly authentic web page it was not easily possible for the visitors of the online profile to discover that the identity was falsified. The attacker placed a link, supposedly to a video, on the profile page. In fact, this link lead to a forged log-in page on an external website. The attacker stored the victim's log-in data obtained in this way in a so called drop zone.\nIn general, spying out access data of a social network does not mean a financial loss for the users.\nIf, however, the data falls into the wrong hands, a loss of image may be a possible consequence of an online profile manipulated by phishers. In the present case, the attacker did not exploit a vulnerability in the web application. This phishing variant is possible on any online platform which does not verify the identity of the users. More significant damage than manipulations to profiles can be caused by sending messages within the online platform which contain links to websites manipulated with malware. Due to the basis of trust between the users, the attacker should have a high success rate. The same rule as for phishing e-mails applies to social networks: links contained in messages should be encountered with a healthy scepticism.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.159 Creation of movement profiles using Bluetooth", "description": "If the Bluetooth interface of devices is turned on, the position of these devices may be located. For this purpose, several Bluetooth receivers are required, ideally with enhanced reception using additional antennas or amplifiers. In laboratory environments, Bluetooth devices could be located over distances of up to 2 kilometres. Depending on the attackers' equipment, it is irrelevant whether the Bluetooth device was set to visible or invisible.\nUsing this method, it is basically possible to create a movement profile of a person by recording the positions of the Bluetooth device over an extended period of time as the Bluetooth device ID is always assigned to one device and can therefore usually be attributed to one person.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.160 Abuse of the Bluetooth profiles", "description": "Bluetooth provides individual profiles for standardised data exchange, transmission of messages and configuration. These profiles may be exploited to access Bluetooth end devices and manipulate them, to listen in on them and/or to steal data. Some examples of the threats caused by misuse of these profiles are described below.\nIn order to access another Bluetooth end device, the end devices usually need to be paired.\nAuthentication is always part of the pairing. However, the Bluetooth specification allows access to the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) without authentication prior to the pairing. The Bluetooth devices use this protocol to exchange the available profiles. In the past, Bluetooth implementations became known that included profiles that were not displayed via the SDP. Apparently, the manufacturers had opened a kind of backdoor. Based on this vulnerability, individual profiles could be used to exchange data between Bluetooth end devices without a prior pairing, i.e. without authentication.\n* For example, an attacker may use the OBEX Push Profile intended for simple data exchange to read out calendar entries and phone books. If the end device also supports an OBEX-based FTP server, the attacker also gains write access to the end device.\n* Due to the missing authentication, the HID profile which is provided to enter data using input devices (i.e. mouse or keyboard) may also be used. If authentication is omitted and there is already a successful pairing, e.g. between a keyboard and a computer, this information can be used to simulate another input device and to record keyboard input using keylogger software, for example.\nEven more dangerous is the misuse of the SIM Access profile. With this profile, direct access to the SIM cards of mobile phones using Bluetooth is possible. Typically, this profile is used with integrated car phones that try to access another phone via Bluetooth. Due to the direct access to the SIM card, the mobile connection may be manipulated without the user realising this. For example, using the SIM Access profile the SIM Application Toolkit implemented in many SIM cards may be used to send the session key used to encrypt the mobile connection via SMS. With this session key, recorded communication can be decrypted and spied on via the wireless interface of a mobile phone. Combining the Bluetooth and mobile communication technologies creates attack scenarios that would not be possible with each technology alone.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.161 Falsified responses to XDMCP broadcasts on terminal servers", "description": "The X-Window system frequently used in Unix systems is an application that can be used to display windows on the screen and to be able to read keyboard and screen input. Only in combination with a graphical user interface such as KDE or Gnome, are users able to operate Unix systems intuitively without entering any commands using the command line.\nThe X-Window system consists of an X-server and an X-client. The X-server receives signals from the input devices, e.g. mouse and keyboard, and outputs information to the output devices, e.g. screens. The X-client is the actual application processing the inputs and outputs of the X-server and forwarding these to the respective applications. The X-client communicates with the X-server, processes the signals, and executes the commands this way. The X-client and the X-server may be located on one IT system, but the two components may also communicate using a network connection. For this, the X-server is installed on the workstation PCs the input and output devices are connected to and the X-client is installed on a central terminal server. An IT system where only an X-server, but no X-clients or other applications are installed is called X-terminal.\nX Display Manager\nFor user authentication, an X Display Manager (XDM) can be used that is also installed on the terminal server, just like the X-client. The XDM contains a graphical login screen that can normally be used to enter the user name and the password. In order to be able to authenticate to the X-client, the X-terminal establishes a data link to the XDM using the network.\nX Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)\nThe X-terminals and the XDM normally communicate using XDMCP (X Display Manager Control Protocol). In order to establish a connection, the X-terminals need to know the host name or IP address of the XDMs. For this, the following modes may be used:\n* Direct\nIn the Direct mode, the X-terminal is provided with the host name or the IP address of the XDM in its configuration. After having started the terminal or the terminal emulation, the client connects to the XDM and shows a login window.\n* Indirect\nWhen using the Indirect mode, a connection is also established to a dedicated host. In a first step, the host provides a list of possible XDMs that can then be selected by the user using a menu of the so-called Chooser.\n* Broadcast\nIf the terminal provides the network with a Broadcast message, correspondingly configured XDMs signal their availability. As a consequence, the terminals connect to the host that responds first or allow the user to choose the server using the Chooser.\nUsers can use the \"Broadcast\" mode in order to log in to different XDMs without having to register on the X-terminals. Unlike in the \"Direct\" mode, if new XDMs are added or if existing XDMs are removed, the X-terminals must not be re-configured. If several Choosers are to be used or if the IP address of the Chooser's XDM is changed, the configuration of the X-terminal must not be changed in the \"Broadcast\" mode either.\nIf \"Broadcast\" is used, an attacker may install his/her own XDM responding to the queries of the\nX-terminal. If the user enters his/her user name and password into the login screen of the XDM, the attacker may obtain the login information this way and use this information for later attacks.\nDepending on the knowledge of the attacker, he/she may provide the user with an environment on a terminal server controlled by the attacker just like the XDM. If the user does not recognise that he/she us using the terminal server of the attacker and accesses programs, resources, and backends during a session, additional confidential information may be spied out.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.162 Redirecting X-Window sessions", "description": "By separating the X-server from the X-client in the X-Window system, these components can be operated on different IT systems. This way, applications and graphical user interfaces can be executed and displayed on different IT systems. Here, the terminal servers which the applications are executed on are connected to the X-terminal, which connects the input and output devices, by means of a data link. The screen content is generated in the terminal server, but the output is redirected to the X-terminal.\nNormally, not only inputs and outputs, individual instances of the applications, or user interfaces, but several instances may be redirected from the terminal server to the X-terminal For example, the user may simultaneously open several different graphical user interfaces on one terminal server, which he/she may switch between.\nHowever, it is not only possible to redirect different instances on a terminal server to an X-terminal, but even an instance on the terminal server can be redirected to different X-terminals. If an attacker manages to not only redirect the screen output on the X-terminal of the user, but also to his/her terminal, he/she may intercept and read the input and output of the user.\nAdditionally, he/she can redirect the graphical user interface or the applications of a terminal server controlled by the attacker to the X-terminal of the user. If the attacker manages to falsify the work environment and if the user s not aware of this falsification, the user may provide the attacker with sensitive information. An example for this includes the input of a password not displayed on the screen, but that can be read by the attacker nevertheless.\nCombinations of the attacks mentioned above are also possible.\n", "examples": "\"xnest\" is a part of many systems which X-Window is installed on. This application allows starting of one or several additional sessions during a terminal session and displaying of these in any size on the screen. It can be used for testing new configurations or remote maintenance.\nAn attacker now manages to start this software on the client of the user, e.g. because the user did not log out when leaving the workplace or due to a weakness in the implementation of the X-server service. Within xnest, started with full screen resolution, the attacker starts the usual login dialogue of the terminal, but redirects its output to a second computer using the network, which is how the attacker gains possession of the authentication information of the user.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.163 Attacks on Exchange systems", "description": "The information stored in the databases of a Microsoft Exchange server can also be made available for mobile access from the internet.

Even an already optimised configuration includes a residual risk.\n* A Microsoft Exchange system is very complex. A system consisting of Exchange servers and Outlook clients further increases complexity. This complexity (also the security-relevant settings) may result in misconfigurations and hence in the creation of security loopholes.\n* Due to the huge range of functions of a Microsoft Exchange system and the possible integration into corresponding background systems, such as Unified Messaging, Content Management, and Enterprise Resource Planning systems, for example, security loopholes of a server may have effects on the background systems. In this way, it is generally sufficient to exploit a single weakness in a single function package.\n", "examples": "* In Outlook-Web-Access, an attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack via the network by sending a manipulated URL to the server, causing the affected components to crash due to an overloaded memory.\n* By means of a manipulated command in SMTP, an attacker could crash an Exchange server.

If this data is not protected appropriately during transmission and saving, it may be read or manipulated by unauthorised persons.\nThe different transmission routes and storage locations of the data regarding web applications result in specific threats that are explained on the basis of the following examples:\n* Access and form data a user enters into the web browser are buffered in the browser cache.\nIf an attacker gained access to the computer, he/she can read the browser cache and therefore the data worthy of protection, because the browser cache is normally not protected separately (e. g. by encryption).\n* If GET parameters are transmitted in the URL, these may be saved to the log files of IT systems between the web application and the client (e. g. proxy servers). Proxy servers normally log the calling URL, including the transmitted GET parameters.

Furthermore, confidential data in the GET parameters may be disclosed when sending a link or by viewing the browser history.\n* If the session data of a web application must be stored on the client, this is frequently performed by saving the data in cookies.

Using a login process performed repeatedly, for example valid combinations consisting of user names and passwords can be determined systematically (brute-force) or lists with valid user names can be generated (enumeration).\nIn addition, calling up resource-intensive functions repeatedly (e.g. complex database queries) can be misused for denial-of-service attacks at the application level. Whereas denial-of-service attacks often require several connection attempts at the network level, attacks at the web application level can often be carried out more efficiently.\n", "examples": "* If a form can be filled out and sent automatically as part of an online survey, then an attacker can easily corrupt the survey result making use of automated voting via script.\n* The information on registered users (e.g. profile names and email addresses) can be called up using an URL of the web application (e.g. http://host.tld/app/userDetails.php?UserID='\"'). If this function is called up in an automated manner (for example by the simple incrementing of the numerical UserID), then a large number of user information can be collected with little effort (enumeration). The information collected can be used for sending SPAM, for instance.\n* If the user accounts are locked after five failed login attempts for 10 minutes to make brute-force attacks more difficult and if an attacker knows the user names of the web application, then failed login attempts can be automatically provoked to these user accounts. As a result, these user accounts are permanently locked and the web application can no longer be used by the users.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.167 Errors in the logic of web applications", "description": "To ensure that business processes can be mapped by a web application, individual functions are usually summarized in a complex application logic. In this respect, it is critical to a process in which order the individual functions or process steps are called up.\nIf such logical sequences are used for security-relevant functions of the web application, for example for user authentication, they can be manipulated unexpectedly (e.g. by bypassing individual steps) and thus controlled. Under certain circumstances, an attacker is able to bypass the security mechanism.\nIn addition, malicious actions can also be triggered when functions of the web application can be used for purposes other than those intended. For example, a contact form of a web application can be misused for sending SPAM when the specified contact address in the form can be changed.\nOther examples:\n* An web application has an input field to be restricted to a length of 20 characters. In addition to this, the data entered into this field is filtered by the web application. In this respect, filtering the data entered is more CPU-intensive than checking the length of the character string. If the more complex filtering is carried out prior to the length check, an attacker can fill the field with a very long character string that is processed by the resource-intensive filter component.

If the victim follows this link and authenticates subsequently to the web application using the SessionID transmitted by the attacker, then the attacker can use the application afterwards using the SessionID known to him. In this way, the attacker is able to access the web application within the security context of the user attacked and to use functions that are not available to an unauthenticated user.\n* In the event of a session hijacking attack (session take-over), the victim has already logged in on the web application using a valid SessionID. If the SessionID is not selected by the web application on a random basis (e.g. simple incrementing of a counter when assigning SessionIDs), an attacker can guess valid SessionIDs trying them in a targeted manner and take over the corresponding sessions of the users logged in.\n* If sessions of inactive users of a web application do not become automatically invalid after a specific time interval (session timeout), the sessions of users who did not log out properly of the application (e.g. closing the browser) remain still valid.

Here, an attacker tries to send malicious code (usually scripts such as JavaScript that can be run on the browser side) indirectly to the client of the user of the web application.\nIf the input and output data of a web application are not validated adequately, then an attacker can smuggle in malicious code into the web application (e.g. within a comment to an item) and so spread it. If an infected website is called up by the user, the client (for example, browser) executes the inserted malicious code. From the user's perspective, the malicious code comes from the web application and is thus classified as trustworthy. Therefore, the malicious code is interpreted within the security context of the web application and the attacker is able to execute commands within the context of a possibly existing session of the affected user.\nThere are three classes of XXS attacks:\n* persistent (permanent)\n* reflected (non-persistent)\n* DOM-based (local).\nThe following examples illustrate the differences between the attack classes:\n* An attacker is able to leave an entry in a guest book containing JavaScript code. If the user calls up the corresponding guest book entry, the script is transmitted and executed by the browser. The script is executed within the security context of the web application and thus has access to the user's SessionID stored on the client side in the cookie if this session cookie was set (incorrectly) without HttpOnly flag. This information is communicated from the script to the attacker who can use the SessionID and thus take over the session of an authenticated user. Since the JavaScript code is only interpreted by the browser and not displayed, it is very difficult for the user to notice this process. This attack is a persistent XSS attack, as the malicious code is stored in the guest book entry and thus permanently in the web application.\n* An attacker prepares the GET parameter of an URL so that it contains this JavaScript code. As the web application uses the parameter used without checking it for the preparation of the website, the JavaScript code smuggled in is transmitted to the client and executed by the browser within the security context of the web application. If the attacker is able to spread out such a prepared link in this manner (for example, by email) and if a user who is logged in clicks on this link, then the malicious script is executed in the user's browser. Such a XSS attack is referred to as reflected or non-persistent attack, as the malicious code is not stored permanently, but is directly sent back by the web application after the entry has been made.\n* JavaScript-Code processes parameters from the URL (e.g. http://host.tld/param=\"contents\") on a website and integrates them into the website so that they can be displayed. Thus, manipulating the parameters makes it possible to integrate any contents into the website. If the website with the malicious JavaScript code in the parameter is called up, this code is integrated into the website and executed by the browser. Contrary to the previous types of attacks, the malicious code is not inserted into the website by the web application, but only locally by the browser using the JavaScript processing of the URL parameters on the client side. In this case, the malicious code can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) environment and, in addition to this, change the website structure and contents.\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.171 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF, XSRF, Session Riding)", "description": "If writing activities of a web application can be used without any further review of the authenticity of the HTTP request (e.g. with the help of tokens in hidden form fields), an attacker may provide the user with a prepared link for executing a command.\nFor example, the link can be transmitted to a user with the help of social engineering methods (e.g. as a link in an email) containing the execution request. If the user is logged in to a web application with a current session and if the user follows the prepared link, the web application executes the transmitted command. Here, the web application interprets the HTTP request as an activity deliberately performed by the user. At the same time, such a link may contain privileged commands such as the modification of access data or the creation of a new user. The user may not even notice this process and the user only sees a message regarding the successfully executed activity on the display.\nAs opposed to XSS (see T 5.170 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)), the objective of the attack is not to execute script code, but unauthorised, writing activities in the context of the logged in user.\nUsing a combination of CSRF and XSS, it is possible to control the client unobtrusively by executing scripts so that no interaction of the user is required.

If the access authorisation is implemented improperly by the web application, an attacker may expand his/her authorisations and gain access to protected areas and data of the web application. This is normally performed by targeted manipulated input of the attacker.\nFor example, possible aims of an attack include configuration files with fixedly coded access data for background systems, protected areas, or functions of the web application.\nBelow, possible weaknesses regarding the authorisation of accesses to web resources are listed.\n", "examples": "* The so-called Null byte (%00 in the URL code) is interpreted differently by the filter component of the web application and the background systems. This way, the filter component of the web application accepts the character string malware.exe%00.jpg as file name with the permissible file extension .jpg for images. On the contrary, the operating system rejects a file with the file name malware.exe, because it considers the Null byte, as well as the following characters as not belonging to the file name. This way, restrictions to certain file types can be bypassed by attackers in order to install malware on the web application, for example.\n* When entering path information, a relative reference (with the help of so-called Path Traversal) can be used to retrieve resources not designed for being accessed using the web application (e. g. config.xml). This may allow for downloading or overwriting files worthy of protection, e.g. configuration files, from the file system in an unauthorised manner.\nRelative path information cannot only be used in order to access files of the web application, but also to retrieve resources of the underlying IT system.\n* Web applications frequently use object references for addressing a resource in a background system (e.g. http://host.tld/get.php?id=2). This way, resources such as content for displaying a website can be assigned to a database entry. If object references are not taken into consideration by the authorisation component, it may be possible to access trustworthy resources by manipulating the reference id in the URL.\n* An option for protecting information of a web application used sometimes consists in only displaying the URL linking this information to authorised users. Unauthorised users do not know the URL. With the help of systematic trial and error, an attacker may attempt to guess the URL and to gain access to protected information and/or functions of the web application this way. This attack is called \"Forced Browsing\".\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.173 Integration of third party data and malicious code in web applications", "description": "If the input and output data of a web application is validated insufficiently, an attacker may integrate content such as malicious code for manipulating the web application of the client (e.g. web browser). The integrated data is presented to the user within the security context of the web application. Accordingly, the user of the web application cannot or only to a limited extent identify the manipulated parts of the web application. This way, the attacker can exploit the position of trust of the authenticated user regarding the web application.\nBoth the clients and the servers of the web application may be subject to an attack by the integrated malicious code. For example, data embedded by an attacker may contain malicious code to be executed on the clients (e.g. for reading confidential data) or forged login forms designed to steal access data. If the integrated program code is executed in the web application, the operating system underlying the web application may also be compromised.\n", "examples": "* Parameters in the URL can be used to integrate third party content into dynamic websites that cannot be differentiated from the content of the web application (e. g. http://host.tld/index.php?frame=http://angreifer.tld&title=modofied title). In this, the transmitted title parameter is embedded in the returned website of the web application as title within the HTML document. The frame parameter is also used as a source for a frame on the website. This way, any content and program code (e.g. JavaScript) can be integrated into the website using the parameter values.\n* A forwarding function accepts any values as target address. Subsequently, a manipulated parameter can be used by an attacker to induce forwarding to untrustworthy websites (e. g. http://host.tld/redirect.php?target=http://angreifer.tld). Based on the initial domain of the web application, the user expects to be forwarded to a trustworthy address. The attacker may use this in order to trigger a phishing attack by forwarding to a forged login page for entering the access data.\n* Third party content of partners (e. g. ads in an iFrame) can be integrated into web applications. Normally, this content is controlled by the partner and not by the operator of the web application. If the partner integrates malware or undesired content, this may damage the reputation of the web application operator, because the user sees the content in the context of the web application. Furthermore, the clients of the users may be infected and thus compromised by the malware.\n* The upload function of the web application can be used to save any files to the directory structure on the server. This way, damaged scripts may be stored for execution on the web application or existing files (e.g. configuration files) may be overwritten. Uploading large amounts of data may also impair the service.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.174 Injection attacks", "description": "Within the framework of an injection attack, an attacker tries to inject commands into the web application and to execute these. In this, the attack is normally directed against an interpreter and/or the parser used by the web application.\nIf, for example, incoming data of the web application is validated insufficiently, input (e.g. form data, cookies, or HTTP headers) may be selected in such a way that they are interpreted as commands by the web application and the used interpreters and/or parsers (e. g. SQL database,\nLDAP directory service). This way, unauthorised commands for reading or manipulating data may be transmitted.\nIf any system commands can be executed by means of injection, the attacker can use the web application as a substitute for a system shell. In this, the sent system commands are normally executed within the security context and therefore with the privileges of the web application or the used interpreter and/or parser.\nInjection attacks are classified in types of attacks on the basis of the attacked interpreters/parsers.\nThe following examples illustrate this classification:\n* SQL injection (see also T 5.131 SQL injection)\n* LDAP injection * Mail-Command injection * OS-Command injection * SSI injection\n* XPath injection * Code injection\n", "examples": ""}, {"heading": "# T 5.175 Clickjacking", "description": "Within the framework of a clickjacking attack, parts of a website are covered during display so that transparent layers the user cannot see superimpose the displayed website content.\nAny content or controls can be integrated into these transparent layers without them being visible to the user. If the user clicks the alleged content of the website, the click is not sent to the visible layer, but to the superimposed layers and is therefore hijacked. The name of the attack clickjacking results from the combination of the words Click and Jacking derived from hijacking.\nAlong with mouse clicks, keyboard input can also be diverted to third party servers with the help of transparent displayed text boxes (e.g. positioned over password boxes).\n", "examples": "* An attacker participates in a scheme for advertisements where the amount of the commission is determined based on the clicks made by the users (click remuneration or pay-per-click). In so doing, he superimposes a part of the web application with an invisible link to the advertisement so that the user clicks the advertisement without noticing it. This increases the number of clicks and therefore the commission to be paid.\n* An attacker places an invisible \"Like\" button for his/her own Facebook page on a website always following the mouse pointer. This is not discernible for the user. If the user clicks anywhere on the site, the \"Like\" function of Facebook is executed and he/she sends his/her Facebook data to the attacker who can further exploit it.\n"}, {"heading": "# T 5.176 Compromising the logged data transmission during centralised logging", "description": "If the logged data is stored centrally, the recorded information is transmitted to the logging server where it is processed and analysed. The transmitted logging events may contain personal information such as user names that can be assigned to a specific person. If the logged data is transmitted using insecure and unencrypted transmission routes, it may be tapped or manipulated.\nExploitation of in-band connections\nIf IT systems are operated in an insecure network, the systems are most likely exposed to attacks from the network. A packet filter in a security gateway positioned between the public network and the Application Level Gateway is an example. If logged information of the packet filter is to be sent to a centralised logging server, a data connection to the centralised logging server using the Application Level Gateway and possibly using further systems is required (in-band). This connection option could also be used by an attacker, because externally initiated connections into the internal networks constitute a vulnerability. Within the framework of an out-of-band connection, these problems do not occur, because the logged data is transported within a proprietary, closed network. However, this is significantly more complex. A separate network infrastructure must be established and another network must be administered. Furthermore, the possible damage may be severe if an attacker managed to compromise the out- of-band network.\nCompromising the centralised logging server\nIf a centralised logging server not positioned in a separate administration network is compromised, it facilitates attacks to further components due to its central location. Since the server must be available both to IT systems upstream and downstream of the security gateway, it provides the attacker with the opportunity to bypass the security gateway of an information system. This way, the data traffic between the email server and the logging server could be recorded with the help of a network analysis tool and possible personal data may be read, for example. Moreover, an attacker can read and manipulate logged data.\nManipulated logged data\nIf an attacker manipulates logged data, its integrity and completeness are challenged and its validity and reliability are no longer guaranteed. Manipulated log messages may cause dramatic problems even regarding an IT early-warning system if only an incomplete picture of the situation can be generated causing attacks to IT systems or applications to remain unnoticed, for example. One reason for incomplete logged data may be the use of network protocols such as the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) which do not provide any mechanisms for checking whether all packets were transmitted completely.\nBandwidth bottlenecks\nDue to the large amount of logged data transmitted through the network in addition to the user data, bandwidth bottlenecks may result in the transmission of the log messages impairing the transmission of the user data. Furthermore, bandwidth bottlenecks may cause log information to be forwarded in a delayed manner or to be lost entirely. In an IT early-warning system, this may cause dramatic problems, because an overall picture of the information system can only be generated through the sum of the individual partial information of the different IT systems.\n", "examples": "* While planning the use of a centralised logging server, it was decided that the logged data is to be transmitted using a network interface (in-band). The messages are transmitted through the network in an encrypted manner due to the log messages being tunnelled via SSL.\nHowever, tunnelling causes a security gap in the security gateway an attacker may use in order to penetrate the internal network.\n* The logged data is transmitted from the different IT systems to the centralised logging server by using the syslog protocol sending the messages via UDP protocol without any connection establishment. Some log messages are lost due to a temporary bandwidth bottleneck. Since no additional mechanisms are used in order to guarantee that all data packets arrive at the destination, a short web server failure is not noticed.\n* For years, both the user and the logged data are transferred using one and the same network interface (in-band) within the information system of a medium-sized company. Due to increased utilisations and a lack of caches, relevant logged data was again and again deleted in favour of higher priority user data during the past months. This resulted in the failure of a file server being detected too late which is why operations had to be suspended for an entire day.\n"}]
